SNEERWELL
and
SNAKE
discovered at a tea-table
THE paragraphs you say Mr Snake were all inserted
They were Madam and as I copied them myself in a seigned hand there can be no suspicion from whence they came
Did you circulate the report of Lady Brittles intrigue with Captain Boastall
Thats in as fine a train as your Ladyship could wish in the common course of things I think it must reach Mrs Clackets ears within twenty-four hours and then the business you know is as good as done
Why yes Mrs Clacket has talents and a great deal of industry
True Madam and has been tolerably successful in her day to my knowledge she has been the cause of six matches being broken off and three sons disinherited of four forced elopments as many close confinements nine separate maintenances and two divorces —nay I have more than once traced her causing a
tete a tete
in the Town and Country Magazine when the parties never saw one another before in the whole course of their lives
Why yes she has genius but her manner is too gross
True Madam she has a fine tongue and a bold invention but then her colouring is too dark and the outlines rather too extravagant she wants that delicacy of hint and mellowness of sneer which distinguishes your Ladyships scandal
You are partial Snake
Not in the least every body will allow that Lady Sneerwell can do more with a word or look than many others with the most laboured detail even though they accidentally happen to have a little truth on their side to support it
Yes my dear Snake and Ill not deny the pleasure I feel at the success of my schemes

both rise

wounded myself in the early part of my life by the envenomed tongue of slander I confess nothing can give me greater satisfaction than reducing others to the level of my own injured reputation
True Madam but there is one affair in which you have lately employed me wherein I confess I am at a loss to guess at your motives
I presume you mean with regard to my friend Sir Peter Teazle and his family
I do here are two young men to whom Sir Peter has acted as guardian since their fathers death the eldest possessing the most amiable character and universally well spoken of the youngest the most dissipated wild extravagant young fellow in the world the former an avowed admirer of your Ladyship and apparently your favourite the latter attached to Maria Sir Peters ward and confessedly admired by her Now on the face of these circumstances it is utterly unaccountable to me why you the widow of a city Knight with a large fortune should not immediately close with the passion of a man of such character and expectation as Mr Surface and more so why you are so uncommonly earnest to destroy the mutual attachment subsisting between his brother Charles and Maria
Then at once to unravel this mystery I must inform you that love has no share whatever in the intercourse between Mr Surface and me
No—
No his real views are to Maria or her fortune while in his brother he finds a favoured rival he is therefore obliged to mask his real intentions and profit by my assistance
Yet still I am more puzzled why you should interest yourself for his success
Heavens how dull you are cant you surmise a weakness I have hitherto through shame concealed even from you Must I confess it that Charles that profligate that libertine that bankrupt in fortune and reputation that he it is for whom I am thus anxious and malicious and to gain whom I would sacrifice every thing
Now indeed your conduct appears consistent but pray how came you and Mr Surface so confidential
For our mutual interest he pretends to and recommends sentiment and liberality but I know him to be artful close and malicious In short a sentimental knave while with Sir Peter and indeed with most of his acquaintances he passes for a youthful miracle of virtue good sense and benevolence
Yes I know Sir Peter vows he has not his fellow in England and has praised him as a man of character and sentiment
Yes and with the appearance of being sentimental he has brought Sir Peter to favour his addresses to Maria while poor Charles has no friend in the house though I fear he has a powerful one in Marias heart against whom we must direct our schemes

Mr Surface Madam
Shew him up

he generally calls about this hour—I dont wonder at peoples giving him to me for a lover
Enter
JOSEPH SURFACE
Lady Sneerwell good morning to you— Mr Snake your most obedient
Snake has just been rallying me upon our attachment but I have told him our real views I need not tell you how useful he has been to us and believe me our confidence has not been ill placed
Oh Madam tis impossible for me to suspect a man of Mr Snakes merit and accomplishments
Oh no compliments but tell me when you saw Maria or whats more material to us your brother
I have not seen either since I left you but I can tell you they never met some of your stories have had a good effect in that quarter
The merit of this my dear Snake belongs to you but do your brothers distresses increase
Every hour I am told he had another execution in his house yesterday—in short his dissipation and extravagance exceeds any thing I ever heard
Poor Charles
Aye Poor Charles indeed notwithstanding his extravagance one cannot help pitying him I wish it was in my power to be of any essential service to him for the man who does not feel for the distresses of a brother even though merited by his own misconduct deserves to be—
Now you are going to be moral and forget you are among friends
Gad so I was ha ha—Ill keep that sentiment till I see Sir Peter ha ha however it would certainly be a generous act in you to rescue Maria from such a libertine who if he is to be reclaimed at all can only be so by a person of your superior accomplishments and understanding
I believe Lady Sneerwell heres company coming Ill go and copy the letter I mentioned to your Ladyship Mr Surface your most obedient
Exit Snake
Mr Snake your most obedient I wonder Lady Sneerwell you would put any confidence in that fellow
Why so
I have discovered he has of late had several conferences with old Rowley who was formerly my fathers steward he has never you know been a friend of mine
And do you think he would betray us
Not unlikely and take my word for it Lady Sneerwell that fellow has not virtue enough to be faithful to his own villanies
Enter
MARIA
Ah Maria my dear how do you do Whats the matter
Nothing Madam only this odious lover of mine Sir Benjamin Backbite and his uncle Crabtree just called in at my guardians but I took the first opportunity to slip out and run away to your Ladyship
Is that all
Had my brother Charles been of the party you would not have been so much alarmed
Nay now you are too severe for I dare say the truth of the matter is Maria heard you was here and therefore came but pray Maria what particular objection have you to Sir Benjamin that you avoid him so
Oh Madam he has done nothing but his whole conversation is a perpetual libel upon all his acquaintance
Yes and the worst of it is there is no advantage in not knowing him for he would abuse a stranger as soon as his best friend and his uncle is as bad
For my part I own wit looses its respect with me when I see it in company with malice— what think you Mr Surface
To be sure Madam—to smile at a jest that plants a thorn in the breast of another is to become a principal in the mischief
Pash—there is no possibility of being witty without a little ill nature the malice in a good thing is the barb that makes it stick—What is your
real
opinion Mr Surface
Why my opinion is that where the spirit of railery is suppressed the conversation must be naturally insipid
Well I will not answer how far slander may be allowed but in a man I am sure it is despicable— We have pride envy rivalship and a thousand motives to depreciate each other but the male slanderer must have the cowardice of a woman before he can traduce one
Enter
SERVANT
Mrs Candour Madam if you are at leisure will leave her carriage
Desire her to walk up

Exit servant

Now Maria heres a character to your taste though Mrs Candour is a little talkative yet every body allows she is the best natured sort of woman in the world
Yes—with the very gross affectation of good nature she does more mischief than the direct malice of old Crabtree
Faith its very true and whenever I hear the current of abuse running hard against the characters of my best friends I never think them in such danger as when Candour undertakes their defence
Hush Hush here she is
Enter Mrs
CANDOUR
Oh my dear Lady Sneerwell well how do you do Mr Surface your most obedient—Is there any news abroad No nothing good I suppose —No nothing but scandal—nothing but scandal
Just so indeed Madam
Nothing but scandal—Ah Maria how do you do child what is every thing at an end between you and Charles What he is too extravagant —Aye the town talks of nothing else
I am sorry Madam the town is so ill employed
Aye so am I child—but what can one do we cant stop peoples tongues—They hint too that your guardian and his Lady dont live so agreeably together as they did
I am sure such reports are without foundation
Aye so these things generally are —Its like Mr Fashions affair with Colonel Goterie though indeed that affair was never rightly cleared up and it was but yesterday Miss Prim assured me that Mr and Mrs Honeymoon were now become mere man and wife like the rest of their acquaintance She likewise hinted that a certain widow in the next street had got rid of her dropsy and recovered her shape in a most surprizing manner
The licence of invention some people give themselves is astonishing
Tis so—but how will you stop peoples tongues Twas but yesterday Mrs Clacket informed me that our old friend Miss Prudely was going to elope and that her guardian caught her just stepping into the York Diligence with her dancingmaster I was informed too that Lord Flimsey caught his wife at a house of no extraordinary fame and that Tom Saunter and Sir Harry Idle were to measure swords on a similar occasion—But I dare say there is no truth in the story and I would not circulate such a report for the world
You report—No no no
No no—tale-bearers are just as bad as the tale-makers

SERVANT

Exit servant
Enter Sir
BENJAMIN
and
CRABTREE
Lady Sneerwell your most obedient humble servant Mrs Candour I believe you dont know my nephew Sir Benjamin Backbite he has a very pretty taste for poetry and shall make a rebus or a cherard with any one
Oh fie uncle
In faith he will did you ever hear the lines he made at Lady Pontos route on Miss Frizzles feathers catching fire and the rebuses—his first is the name of a fish the next a great naval commander and—
Uncle now prythee
I wonder Sir Benjamin you never publish any thing
Why to say the truth tis very vulgar to print—and as my little productions are chiefly satyrs and lampoons on particular persons I find they circulate better by giving copies in confidence to the friends of the parties—however I have some love elegies which when favoured by this Ladys smiles

to Maria

I mean to give to the public
Foregad Madam theyll immortalize you

to Maria

you will be handed down to posterity like Petrarchs Laura or Wallers Sacharissa
Yes Madam I think youll like them

to Maria

when you shall see them on a beautiful quarto type where a neat rivulet of text shall murmur through a meadow of margin—foregad theyll be the most elegant things of their kind
But odso Ladies did you hear the news
What—do you mean the report of—
No Madam thats not it—Miss Nicely going to be married to her footman
Impossible
Tis very true indeed Madam every thing is fixed and the wedding liveries bespoke
Yes and they do say there were very pressing reasons for it
I heard something of this before
Oh it cannot be and I wonder theyd report such a thing of so prudent a Lady
Oh but Madam that is the very reason that it was believed at once for she has always been so very cautious and reserved that every body was sure there was some reason for it at bottom
It is true there is a sort of puny sickly reputation that would outlive the robuster character of an hundred prudes
True Madam there are Valetudinarians in reputation as well as constitution who being conscious of their weak part avoid the least breath of air and supply their want of stamina by care and circumspection
I believe this may be some mistake you know Sir Benjamin very trifling circumstances have often given rise to the most ingenious tales
Very true—but odso Ladies did you hear of Miss Letitia Pipers losing her lover and her character at Scarborough—Sir Benjamin you remember it
Oh to be sure the most whimsical circumstance
Pray let us hear it
Why one evening at Lady Spadilles assembly the conversation happened to turn upon the difficulty of breeding Nova-Scotia sheep in this country no says a lady present I have seen an instance of it for a cousin of mine Miss Letitia Piper had one that produced twins What what says old Lady Dundizzy whom we all know is as deaf as a post has Miss Letitia Piper had twins—This you may easily imagine set the company in a loud laugh and the next morning it was every where reported and believed that Miss Letitia Piper had actually been brought to bed of a fine boy and girl
Ha ha ha ha
Tis true upon my honour—Oh Mr Surface how do you do I hear your uncle Sir Oliver is expected in town sad news upon his arrival to hear how your brother has gone on
I hope no busy people have already prejudiced his uncle against him—he may reform
True he may for my part I never thought him so utterly void of principle as people say—and though he has lost all his friends I am told nobody is better spoken of amongst the Jews
Foregad if the Old Jewry was a ward Charles would be an Alderman for he pays as many annuities as the
ish Tontine and when he is sick they have prayers for his recovery in all their Synagogues
Yet no man lives in greater splendor They tell me when he entertains his friends he can sit down to dinner with a dozen of his own securities have a score of tradesmen waiting in the antichamber and an officer behind every guests chair
This may be entertaining to you gentlemen —but you pay very little regard to the feelings of a brother
Their malice is intolerable

Aside

Lady Sneerwell I must wish you a good morning Im not very well
Exit Maria
She changes colour
Do Mrs Candour follow her
To be sure I will—poor dear girl who knows what her situation may he
Mrs Candour follows her
Twas nothing but that she could not bear to hear Charles reflected on notwithstanding their difference
The young ladys penchant is obvious
Come dont let this dishearten you— follow her and repeat some of your odes to her and Ill assist you
Mr Surface I did not come to hurt you but depend ont your brother is utterly undone
Oh undone as ever man was—cant raise a guinea
Every thing is sold I am told that was moveable
Not a moveable left except some old bottles and some pictures and they seem to be framed in the wainscot egad
I am sorry to hear also some bad stories of him
Oh He has done many mean things thats certain
But however hes your brother
Aye as hes your brother—well tell you more another opportunity
Yes as hes your brother—well tell you more another opportunity
Exeunt Crabtree and sir Benjamin
Tis very hard for them indeed to leave a subject they have not quite run down
And I fancy their abuse was no more acceptable to your ladyship than to Maria
I doubt her affections are further engaged than we imagine—but the family are to be here this afternoon so you may as well dine where you are we shall have an opportunity of observing her further—in the mean time Ill go and and plot mischief and you shall study
Exeunt
SCENE Sir PETER TEAZLES House
WHEN an old batchelor marries a young wise what is he to expect—Tis now about six months since my Lady Teazle made me the happiest of men—and I have been the most miserable dog ever since—We tifted a little going to church and fairly quarrelled before the bells were done ringing I was more than once nearly choaked with gall during the honey moon and had lost every satisfaction in life before my friends had done wishing me joy—And yet I chose with caution a girl bred wholly in the country who had never known luxury beyond one silk gown or dissipation beyond the annual gala of a race ball— Yet now she plays her part in all the extravagant fopperies of the town with as good a grace is if she had never seen a bush or a grass plot out of Grosvenor-Square —I am sneered at by all my acquaintance— paragraphed in the news-papers—she dissipates my fortune and contradicts all my humours—And yet the worst of it is I doubt I love her or I should never bear all this—but I am determined never to be weak enough to let her know it—No no no
Enter
ROWLEY
Sir Peter your servant how do you find yourself to-day
Very bad Master Rowley very bad indeed
Im sorry to hear that—what has happened to make you uneasy since yesterday
A pretty question truly to a married man
Sure my Lady is not the cause
Why has any one told you she was dead
Come come Sir Peter notwithstanding you sometimes dispute and disagree I am sure you love her
Aye Master Rowley but the worst of it is that in all our disputes and quarrels she is ever in the wrong and continues to thwart and vex me— I am myself the sweetest tempered man in the world and so I tell her an hundred times a day
Indeed Sir Peter
Yes—and then theres Lady Sneerwell and the set she meets at her house encourage her to disobedience and Maria my ward she too presumes to have a will of her own and refuses the man I propose for her designing I suppose to bestow herself and fortune upon that profligate his brother
You know Sir Peter I have often taken the liberty to differ in opinion with you in regard to these two young men for Charles my life ont will retrieve all one day or other—Their worthy father my once honoured master at his years was full as wild and extravagant as Charles now is but at his death he did not leave a more benevolent heart to lament his loss
You are wrong Mr Rowley you are very wrong—by their fathers will you know I became guardian to these young men which gave me an opportunity of knowing their different dispositions but their uncles Eastern liberality soon took them out of my power by giving them an early independence —But for Charles whatever good qualities he might have inherited they are long since squandered away with the rest of his fortune—Joseph indeed is a pattern for the young men of the age—a youth of the noblest sentiments and acts up to the sentiments he professes
Well well Sir Peter I shant oppose your opinion at present though I am sorry you are prejudiced against Charles as this may probably be the most critical period of his life for his uncle Sir Oliver is arrived and now in town
What my old friend Sir Oliver is he arrived I thought you had not expected him this month
No more we did Sir but his passage has been remarkably quick
I shall be heartily glad to see him—tis sixteen years since old Noll and I met—But does he still enjoin us to keep his arrival a secret from his nephews
He does Sir and is determined under a feigned character to make trial of their different dispositions
Ah there is no need of it for Joseph I am sure is the man—But harkye Rowley does Sir Oliver know that I am married
He does Sir and intends shortly to wish you joy
What as we wish health to a friend in a consumption—But I must have him at my house— do you conduct him Rowley Ill go and give orders for his reception

going

We used to rail at matrimony together—he has stood firm to his text—But Rowley dont give him the least hint that my wife and I disagree for I would have him think 
Heaven forgive me
 that we are a happy couple
Then you must be careful not to quarrel whilst he is here
And so we must—but that will be impossible —Zounds Rowley when an old batchelor marries a young wife he deserves—aye he deserves —no—the crime carries the punishment along with it
End of the
FIRST ACT
ACT II
SCENE Sir PETER TEAZLES House
LADY Teazle Lady Teazle I wont bear it
Very well sir Peter you may bear it or not just as you please but I know I ought to have my own way in every thing and whats more I will
What madam is there no respect due to the authority of a husband
Why dont I know that no woman of fashion does as she is bid after her marriage—Though I was bred in the country Im no stranger to that if you wanted me to be obedient you should have adopted me and not married me—Im sure you were old enough
Aye there it is—Oons madam what right have you to run me into all this extravagance
Im sure I am not more extravagant than a woman of quality ought to be
Slife madam Ill have no more sums squandered away upon such unmeaning luxuries you have as many flowers in your dressing room as would turn the Pantheon into a green-house or make a Féte Champetre at a mas—
Lord sir Peter am I to blame that flowers dont blow in cold weather you must blame the climate and not me—Im sure for my part I wish it was spring all the year round and that roses grew under our feet
Zounds madam I should not wonder at your extravagance if you had been bred to it—Had you any of these things before you married me
Lord sir Peter how can you be angry at those little elegant expences
Had you any of those little elegant expences when you married me
For my part I think you ought to be pleased your wife should be thought a woman of taste
Zounds madam you had no taste when you married me
Very true indeed and after having married you I never should pretend to taste again
Very well very well madam you have entirely forgot what your situation was when I first saw you
No no I have not a very disagreeable situation it was or Im sure I never should have married you
You forget the humble state I took you from—the daughter of a poor country squire—when I came to your fathers I found you sitting at your tambour in a linen gown a bunch of keys to your side and your hair combed smoothly over a roll
Yes I remember very well—my daily occupations were to overlook the dairy superintend the poultry make extracts from the family receipt book and combany aunt Deborahs lap dog
Oh I am glad to find you have so good a recollection
My evening employments were to draw patterns for ruffles which I had not materials to make up play at Pope Joan with the curate read a sermon to my aunt Deborah or perhaps be stuck up at an old spinnet to trum my father to sleep after a fox-chace
Then you was glad to take a ride out behind the buttler upon the old dockd coach-horse
No no I deny the butler and the coach-horse
I say you did This was your situation— Now madam you must have your coach viz-a-viz and three powdered coachmen to walk before your chair and in summer two white cats to draw you to Kensington-Gardens and instead of your living in that hole in the country I have brought you home here made a woman of fortune of you a woman of quality —in short madam I have made you my wife
Well and there is but one thing more you can now do to add to the obligation and that is—
To make you my widow I suppose
Hem—
Very well madam very well I am much obliged to you for the hint
Why then will you force me to say shocking things to you But now we have finished our morning conversation I presume I may go to my engagements at Lady Sneerwells
Lady Sneerwell—a precious acquaintance you have made with her too and the set that frequent her house—Such a set mercy on us—Many a wretch who has been drawn upon a hurdle has done less mischief than those barterers of forged lies coiners of scandal and clippers of reputation
How can you be so severe Im sure they are all people of fashion and very tenacious of reputation
Yes so tenacious of it theyll not allow it to any but themselves
I vow sir Peter when I say an ill-natured thing I mean no harm by it for I take it for granted theyd do the same by me
Theyve made you as bad as any of them
Yes—I think I bear my part with a tolerable grace—
Grace indeed—
Well but sir Peter you know you promised to come
Well I shall just call in to look after my own character
Then upon my word you must make haste after me or youll be too late
Exit L Teazle
I have got much by my intended expostulation —What a charming air she has—what a neck and how pleasingly she shews her contempt of my authority— Well though I cant make her love me tis some pleasure to teaze her a little and I think she never appears to such advantage as when she is doing every thing to vex and plague me

BENJAMIN JOSEPH
Mrs
CANDOUR
and
MARIA
NAY positively well have it
Aye aye the epigram by all means
Oh Plague on it its mere nonsense
Faith Ladies twas excellent for an extempore
But Ladies you should be acquainted with the circumstances—You must know that one day last week as Lady Bab Curricle was taking the dust in Hyde Park in a sort of duodecimo phaeton she desires me to write some verses on her ponies upon which I took out my pocket book and in a moment produced the following—
 Sure never were seen two such beautiful ponies
 Other horses are clowns and these macaronies
 To give them this title Im sure cant be wrong
 Their legs are so slim and their tails are so long
There Ladies—done in the crack of a whip—and on horseback too
Oh a very Phoebus mounted—
I must have a copy
Enter Lady
TEAZLE
Lady Teazle how do you do
—I hope we shall see sir Peter
I believe he will wait on your Ladyship presently
Maria my love you look grave come you shall sit down to picquet with Mr Surface
I take very little pleasure in cards—but Ill do as your ladyship pleases
I wonder he should sit down to cards with Maria—I thought he would have taken an opportunity of speaking to me before sir Peter came
Aside
Well now Ill forswear his society
Aside
Whats the matter Mrs Candour
Why they are so censorious they wont allow our friend Miss Vermilion to be handsome
Oh surely shes a pretty woman
Im glad you think so
She has a charming fresh colour
Yes when it is fresh put on
Well Ill swear its natural for Ive seen it come and go
Yes it comes at night and goes again in the morning
True madam it not only goes and comes but whats more egad her maid can fetch and carry it
Well—and what do you think of her sister
What Mrs Evergreen—foregad shes six and fifty if shes a day
Nay Ill swear two or three and sixty is the outside—I dont think she looks more
Oh theres no judging by her looks unless we could see her face
Well if Mrs Evergreen does take some pains to repair the ravages of time she certainly effects it with great ingenuity and surely thats better than the careless manner in which the widow Oaker chalks her wrinkles
Nay now my Lady Sneerwell you are too severe upon the widow—Come it is not that she paints so ill but when she has finished her face she joins it so badly to her neck that she looks like a mended statue in which the connisseur may see at once that the head is modern though the trunks antique
What do you think of Miss Simper
Why she has pretty teeth
Yes and upon that account never shuts her mouth but keeps it always a-jar as it were thus

shews her teeth

Ha ha ha
And yet I vow thats better than the pains Mrs Prim takes to conceal her losses in front— she draws her mouth till it resembles the apperture of a poor box and all her words appear to slide out edgeways as it were thus—
How do you do madam—Yes madam
Ha ha ha very well Lady Teazle I vow you appear to be a little severe
In defence of a friend you know it is but just—But here comes Sir Peter to spoil our pleasantry
Enter Sir
PETER
Ladies your servant—mercy upon me—the whole set—a character dead at every sentence
They wont allow good qualities to any one—not even good nature to our friend Mrs Pursey
What the old fat dowager that was at Mrs Quadrilles last night
Her bulk is her misfortune and when she takes such pains to get rid of it you ought not to reflect on her
Thats very true indeed
Yes—Im told she absolutely lives upon acids and small whey laces herself with pullies— often in the hottest day in summer you shall see her on a little squat poney with her hair platted and turned up like a drummer and away she goes puffing round the ring in a full trot
Mercy on me this is her own relation a person they dine with twice a week
Aside
I vow you shant be so severe upon the dowager for let me tell you great allowances are to be made for a woman who strives to pass for a flirt at six and thirty
Though surely shes handsome still and for the weakness in her eyes considering how much she reads by candle-light tis not to be wondered at
Very true and for her manner I think it very graceful considering she never had any education for her mother you know was a Welch milliner and her father a sugar-baker at Bristol
Aye ye are both of ye too good natured
Well I never will join in the ridicule of a friend so I tell my cousin Ogle and ye all know what pretensions she has
beauty
She has the oddest countenance—a collection of features from all corners of the globe
She has indeed an Irish front
Caledonian locks
Dutch nose
Austrian lips
The complexion of a Spaniard
And teeth a la Chinoise
In short her face resembles a table drote at Spa where no two guests are of a nation
Or a Congress at the close of a general war where every member seems to have a different interest and the nose and chin are the only parties likely to join issue
Ha ha ha
Ha ha—Well I vow you are a couple of provoking toads
Well I vow you shant carry the laugh so—let me tell you that Mrs Ogle
Madam madam tis impossible to stop those good gentlemens tongues but when I tell you Mrs Candour that the lady they are speaking of is a particular friend of mine I hope you will be so good as not to undertake her defence
Well said Sir Peter but you are a cruel creature too phlegmatic yourself for a with and too peevish to allow it to others
True wit madam is more nearly allied to good nature than you are aware of
True Sir Peter I believe they are so near a-kin that they can never be united
or rather madam suppose them to be man and wife one so seldom sees them together
But Sir Peter is such an enemy to scandal I believe he would have it put down by Parliament
Foregad Madam if they considered the sporting with reputations of as much consequence as poaching on manors and passed an act for the preservation of fame they would find many would thank them for the bill
Oh lud—Sir Peter would deprive us of our
privileges
Yes madam and none should then have the liberty to kill characters and run down reputations but
privileged
old maids and
disappointed
widows
Go you monster
But surely you would not be so severe on those who only report what they hear
Yes madam I would have law for them too and wherever the drawer of the lie was not to be found the injured party should have a right to come on any of the endorsers
Well I verily believe there never was a scandalous story without some foundation
Nine out of ten are formed on some malicious invention or idle representation
Come Ladies shall we sit down to cards in the next room
Enter a
SERVANT
who whispers Sir
PETER
Ill come directly—Ill steal away unperceived
Aside
Sir Peter youre not leaving us
I beg pardon Ladies tis particular business and I must—but I leave my character behind me
Exit Sir Peter
Well certainly Lady Teazle that Lord of yours is a strange being I could tell you some stories of him would make you laugh heartily if he was not your husband
Oh never mind that—This way
They walk up and exeunt
You take no pleasure in this society
How can I If to raise a malicious smile at the misfortunes and infirmities of those who are unhappy be a proof of wit and humour Heaven grant me a double portion of dulness
And yet they have no malice in their hearts
Then it is the more inexcusable since nothing but an ungovernable depravity of heart could tempt them to such a practice
And is it possible Maria that you can thus feel for others and yet be cruel to me alone— Is hope to be denied the tenderest passion
Why will you persist to persecute me on a subject on which you have long since known my sentiments
Oh Maria you would not be thus deaf to me but that Charles that libertine is still a favoured rival
Ungenerously urged but whatever my sentiments are with regard to that unfortunate young man be assured I shall not consider myself more bound to give him up because his misfortunes have lost him the regards—even of a brother—
Going out
Nay Maria you shall not leave me with a srown by all thats honest I swear—

Kneels and sees
Lady Teazle
entering behind

Ah Lady Teazle ah you shall not stir—

to Maria

I have the greatest regard in the world for Lady Teazle but if Sir Peter was once to suspect—
Lady Teazle—
What is all this child You are wanting in the next room

Exit Maria

—What is the meaning of all this—What did you take her for me
Why you must know—Maria—by some means suspecting—the—great regard I entertain for your Ladyship—was—was—threatening—if I did not desist to acquaint Sir Peter—and I—I—was just reasoning with her—
You seem to have adopted a very tender method of reasoning—pray do you usually argue on your knees
Why you know shes but a child and I thought a little bombast might be useful to keep her silent—But my dear Lady Teazle when will you come and give me your opinion of my library
Why really I begin to think it not so proper and you know I admit you as a lover no farther than fashion dictates
Oh no more—a mere Platonic Cicisbeo that every Lady is entitled to
No further—and though Sir Peters treatment may make me uneasy it shall never provoke me—
To the only revenge in your power
Go you insinuating wretch—but we shall be missed let us join the company
Ill follow your Ladyship
Dont stay long for I promise you Maria shant come to hear any more of your reasoning
Exit Lady Teazle
A pretty situation I am in—by gaining the wife I shall lose the heiress—I at first intended to make her Ladyship only the instrument in my designs on Maria but—I dont know how it is—I am become her serious admirer I begin now to wish I had not made a point of gaining so very good a character for it has brought me into so many confounded rogueries that I fear I shall be exposed at last

Ha ha and so my old friend is married at last eh Rowley—and to a young wife out of the country ha ha ha That he should buff to old batchelors so long and sink into a husband at last
But let me beg of you sir not to rally him upon the subject for he cannot bear it though he has been married these seven months
Then he has been just half a year on the stool of repentance Poor Sir Peter—But you say he has entirely given up Charles—never sees him eh
His prejudice against him is astonishing and I believe is greatly aggravated by a suspicion of a connexion between Charles and Lady Teazle and such a report I know has been circulated and kept up by means of Lady Sneerwell and a scandalous party who associate at her house where as I am convinced if there is any partiality in the case that Joseph is the favourite
Ay ay I know there are a set of mischievous prating gossips both male and female who murder characters to kill him and rob a young fellow of his good name before he has sense enough to know the value of it—but I am not to be prejudic
against my nephew by any such I promise you —No no if Charles has done nothing false or mean I shall compound for his extravagance
I rejoice sir to hear you say so and am happy to find the son of my old master has one friend left however
What shall I forget Mr Rowley when I was at his years myself—egad neither my brother or I were very prudent youths and yet I believe you have not seen many better men than your old master was
Tis that reflection I build my hopes on— and my life ont Charles will prove deserving of your kindness—But here comes Sir Peter
Enter Sir
PETER
Where is he where is Sir Oliver—Ah my dear friend I rejoice to see you—You are welcome indeed you are welcome—you are welcome to England a thousand—and a thousand times—
Thank you thank Sir Peter—and am glad to find you so well believe me
Ah Sir Oliver—Its sixteen years since last we saw each other—many a bout we have had together in our time
Aye I have had my share—But what I find you are married—hey old boy—Well well it cant be helped and so I wish you joy with all my heart
Thank you thank you—yes Sir Oliver I have entered into that happy state—but we wont talk of that now
Thats true Sir Peter old friends should not begin upon grievances at their first meeting no no no

Aside to Sir Oliver

Have a care Sir —dont touch upon that subject
Well—so one of my nephews I find is a wild young rogue
Oh my dear friend I grieve at your disappointment there—Charles is indeed a sad libertine— but no matter Joseph will make you ample amends— every body speaks well of him
I am very sorry to hear it he has too good a character to be an honest fellow—every body speaks well of him—pshaw—then he has bowed as low to knaves and fools as to the honest dignity of genius and virtue
What the plague are you angry with Joseph for not making enemies
Why not if he has merit enough to deserve them
Well well see him and youll be convinced how worthy he is—Hes a pattern for all the young men of the age—Hes a man of the noblest sentiments
Oh plague of his sentiments—If he salutes me with a scrap of morality in his mouth I shall be sick directly—but dont however mistake me Sir Peter I dont mean to defend Charless errors but before I form my judgment of either of them I intend to make a trial of their hearts and my friend Rowley and I have planned something for that purpose
My life on Josephs honour
Well well give us a bottle of good wine and well drink your Ladys health and tell you all our schemes
Alons—done
And dont Sir Peter be too severe against your old friends son—Odds my life I am not sorry he has run a little out of the course—for my part I hate to see prudence clinging to the green suckers of youth tis like ivy round the saplin and spoils the growth of the tree
Exeunt omnes

SECOND ACT
ACT III
SCENE Sir PETERS House
Enter Sir
PETER
Sir
OLIVER
and
ROWLEY
WELL well well see this man first and then have our wine afterwards—But Rowley I dont see the jest of your scheme
Why Sir this Mr Stanley was a near relation of their mothers and formerly an eminent merchant in Dublin—he failed in trade and is greatly reduced he has applied by letter to Mr Surface and Charles for assistance—from the former of whom he has received nothing but fair promises while Charles in the midst of his own distresses is at present endeavouring to raise a sum of money part of which I know he intends for the use of Mr Stanley
Aye—hes my brothers son
Now Sir we propose that Sir Oliver shall visit them both in the character of Mr Stanley as I have informed them he has obtained leave of his creditors to wait on his friends in person—and in the younger believe me youll find one who in the midst of dissipation and extravagance has still as our immortal Bard expresses it
A tear for pity and a hand open as day for melting charity
What signifies his open hand and purse if he has nothing to give But where is this person you were speaking of
Below Sir waiting your commands—you must know Sir Oliver this is a friendly Jew one who to do him justice has done every thing in his power to assist Charles—who waits—

Enter a servant

desire Mr Moses to walk up
Exit servant
But how are you sure hell speak truth
Why Sir I have persuaded him theres no prospect of his being paid several sums of money he has advanced for Charles but through the bounty of Sir Oliver who he knows is in town therefore you may depend on his being faithful to his interest—Oh here comes the honest Israelite—
Enter
MOSES
Sir Oliver this is Mr Moses—Mr Moses this is Sir Oliver
I understand you have lately had great dealings with my nephew Charles
Yes Sir Oliver I have done all I could for him—but he was ruined before he came to me for assistance
That was unlucky truly for you had no opportunity of shewing your talent
None at all I had not the pleasure of knowing his distresses till he was some thousands worse than nothing
Unfortunate indeed But I suppose you have done all in your power for him
Yes he knows that—This very evening I was to have brought him a gentleman from the city who does not know him and will advance him some monies
What a person that Charles has never borrowed money of before lend him any in his present circumstances
Yes—
What is the gentlemans name
Mr Premium of Crutched Friars formerly a broker
Does he know Mr Premium
Not at all
A thought strikes me—suppose Sir Oliver you was to visit him in that character twill be much better than the romantic one of an old relation you will then have an opportunity of s
ing Charles in all his glory
Egad I like that idea better than the other and then I may visit Joseph afterwards as old Stanley
Gentlemen this is taking Charles rather unawares but Moses you understand Sir Oliver and I dare say will be faithful
You may depend upon me—This is very near the time I was to have gone
Ill accompany you as soon as you please Moses but hold—I had forgot one thing—how the plague shall I be able to pass for a Jew
There is no need—the principal is a Christian
Is he I am very sorry for it—but then again am I not too smartly dressed to look like a money-lender
Not at all—it would not be out of character if you went in your own chariot would it Moses
Not in the least
Well but how must I talk Theres certainly some cant of usury or mode of treating that I ought to know
As I take it Sir Oliver the great point is to be exorbitant in your demands—Eh Moses
Yes dat is very great point
Ill answer fort Ill not be wanting in that eight or ten
per cent
on the loan at least
Oh if you ask him no more as dat youll be ciscovered immediately
Hey what the plague—how much then
that depends upon the circumstances—if he appears not very anxious for the supply you should require only forty or fifty
per cent
but if you find him in great distress and he wants money very bad—you must ask double
Upon my word Sir Oliver—Mr Premium I mean—its a very pretty trade youre learning
Truly I think so and not unprofitable
Then you know you have not the money yourself but are forced to borrow it of a friend
Oh I borrow it for him of a friend—do I
Yes and your friends an unconscionable dog—but you cant help dat
Oh my friends an unconscionable dog—is he
And then he himself has not the monies by him but is forced to sell stock at a great loss
Hes forced to sell stock at a great loss —well really thats very kind of him
But harkye Moses if Sir Oliver was to rail a little at the annuity bill dont you think it would have a good effect
Very much
And lament that a young man must now come to years of discretion before he has it in his power to ruin himself
Aye a great pity
Yes and abuse the public for allowing merit to a bill whose only object was to rescue youth and inexperience from the rapacious gripe of usury and to give the young heir an opportunity of enjoying his fortune without being ruined by coming into possession
So—so—Moses shall give me further instructions as we go together
Youll scarce have time to learn your trade for Charles lives but hard by
Oh never fear—my tutor appears so able that tho Charles lived in the next street it must be my own fault if I am not a compleat rogue before I have turned the corner
Exeunt Sir Oliver and Moses
So Rowley you would have been partial and given Charles notice of our plot
No indeed Sir Peter
Well I see Maria coming I want to have some talk with her
Exit Rowley
Enter
MARIA
So Maria what is Mr Surface come home with you
No Sir he was engaged
Maria I wish you were more sensible to his excellent qualities—does not every time you are in his company convince you of the merit of that amiable young man
You know Sir Peter I have often told you that of all the men who have paid me a particular attention there is not one I would not sooner prefer than Mr Surface
Aye aye this blindness to his merit proceeds from your attachment to that profligate brother of his
This is unkind you know at your request I have forborn to see or correspond with him as I have long been convinced he is unworthy my regard but while my reason condemns his vices my heart suggests some pity for his misfortunes
Ah you had best resolve to think of him no more but give your heart and hand to a worthier object
Never to his brother
Have a care Maria I have not yet made you know what the authority of a guardian is dont force me to exert it
I know that for a short time I am to obey you as my father—but must cease to think you so when you would compell me to be miserable
Exit in tears
Sure never man was plagued as I am I had not been married above three weeks before her father a hale hearty man died—on purpose I believe to plague me with the care of his daughter but here comes my help-mate she seems in mighty good humour I wish I could teaze her into loving me a little
Enter
LADY TEAZLE
Whats the matter Sir Peter What have you done to Maria It is not fair to quarrel and I not by
Ah Lady Teazle it is in your power to put me into good humour at any time
Is it I am glad of it—for I want you to be in a monstrous good humour now come do be good humoured and let me have two hundred pounds
What the plague cant I be in a good humour without paying for it—but look always thus and you shall want for nothing

Pulls out a pocket-book

There theres two hundred pounds for you

going to kiss

now seal me a bond for the payment
No my note of hand will do as well
Giving her hand
Well well I must be satisfied with that—you shant much longer reproach me for not having made you a proper settlement—I intend shortly to surprize you
Do you You cant think Sir Peter how good humour becomes you now you look just as you did before I married you
Do I indeed
Dont you remember when you used to walk with me under the elms and tell me stories of what a gallant you were in your youth and asked me if I could like an old fellow who could deny me nothing
Aye and you were so attentive and obliging to me then
Aye to be sure I was and used to take your part against all my acquaintance and when my cousin Sophy used to laugh at me for thinking of marrying a man old enough to be my father and call you an ugly stiff formal old batchelor I contradicted her and said I did not think you so ugly by any means and that I dard say you would make a good sort of a husband
That was very kind of you—Well and you were not mistaken you have found it so have not you—But shall we always live thus happy
With all my heart—Im—I dont care how soon we leave off quarrelling—provided you will own you are tired first
With all my heart
Then we shall be as happy as the day is long and never never—never quarrel more
Never—never—never—and let our future contest be who shall be most obliging
Aye—
But my dear Lady Teazle—my love —indeed you must keep a strict watch over your temper —for you know my dear that in all our disputes and quarrels you always begin first
No no Sir Peter my dear tis always you that begins
No no—no such thing
Have a care this it not the way to live happy if your fly out thus
No no—tis you
No—tis you
Zounds—I say tis you
Lord I never saw such a man in my life—just what my cousin Sophy told me
Your cousin Sophy is a forward saucy impertinent minx
You are a very great bear I am sure to abuse my relations
But I am well enough served for marrying you—a pert forward rural coquette who had refused half the honest squires in the country
I am sure I was a great fool for marrying you—a stiff crop dangling old batchelor who was unmarried at fifty because nobody would have him
You was very glad to have me—you never had such an offer before
Oh yes I had—there was Sir Tivey Terrier who every body said would be a better match for his estate was full as good as yours and—he has broke his neck since we were married
Very—very well madam—youre an ungrateful woman and may plagues light on me if I ever try to be friends with you again—You shall have a separate maintenance
By all means a separate maintenance
Very well madam—Oh very well Aye madam and I believe the stories of you and Charles—of you and Charles madam—were not without foundation
Take care Sir Peter take care what you say for I wont be suspected without a cause I promise you
A divorce—
Aye a divorce
Aye zounds Ill make an example of myself for the benefit of all old batchelors
Well Sir Peter I see you are going to be in a passion so Ill leave you and when you come properly to your temper we shall be the happiest couple in the world and never—never—quarrel more Ha ha ha
Exit
What the devil cant I make her angry neither—Ill after her—zounds—she must not presume to keep her temper—No no—she may break my heart—but damn it—Im determined she shant keep her temper

Mr Premium—
Oh Mr Premium—very well
Exit
To judge by the servant one would not imagine the master was ruined—Sure this was my brothers house
Yes Sir—Mr Charles bought it of Mr Joseph with furniture pictures &c just as the old gentleman left it—Sir Peter thought it a great piece of extravagance in him
In my mind the others oeconomy in selling it to him was more reprehensible by half
Enter
TRIP
Gentlemen my master is very sorry he has company at present and cannot see you
If he knew who it is that wanted to see him perhaps he would not have sent such a message
Oh yes I told him who it was—I did not forget my little Premium no no
Very well Sir and pray what may your name be
Trip Sir Trip at your service
Very well Mr Trip—you have a pleasant sort of a place here I guess
Pretty well—There are four of us who pass our time agreeably enough—Our wages indeed are but small and sometimes a little in arrear—We have but fifty guineas a year and find our own bags and bouquets
Bags and bouquets—halters and bastinadoes
Oh Moses harkye—did you get that little bill discounted for me
Wants to raise money too—Mercy on me—He has distresses I warrant like a Lord and affects creditors and duns
Aside
Twas not to be done indeed Mr Trip
Gives the note
No why I thought when my friend Brush had set his mark on it it was as good as cash
No indeed it would not do
Perhaps you could get it done by way of annuity
An annuity—A footman raise money by annuity—Well said luxury egad
Aside
Well but you must insure your place
Oh Ill insure my life if you please
Thats more than I would your neck
Aside
Well but I should like to have it done before this damned registry takes place one would not wish to have ones name made public
No certainly—but there is nothing you could deposit
Why theres none of my masters cloaths will fall very soon I believe but I can give a mortgage on some of his winter suits with equity of redemption before Christmas—or a
post obit
on his blue and silver Now these with a few pair of point ruffles by way of security

CHARLES CARELESS
Sir
TOBY
and Gentlemen discovered drinking
Ha ha ha—Fore Heaven you are in the right—the degeneracy of the age is astonishing there are many of our acquaintance who are men of wit genius and spirit but then they wont drink
True Charles they sink into the more substantial luxuries of the table and quite neglect the bottle
Right—besides society suffers by it for instead of the mirth and humour that used to mantle over a bottle of Burgundy their conversation is become as insipid as the Spa water they drink which has all the pertness of Champaigne without its spirit or flavour
But what will you say to those who prefer play to the bottle—Theres Harry Dick and Careless himself who are under a hazard regimen
Psha no such thing—What would you train a horse for the course by keeping him from corn —Let me throw upon a bottle of Burgundy and I never lose at least I never feel my loss and thats the same thing
True besides tis wine that determines if a man be really in love
So it is—Fill up a dozen bumpers to a dozen beauties and she that floats at the top is the girl that has bewitched you
But come Charles you have not given us your real favourite
Faith I have withheld her only in compassion to you for if I give her you must toast a round of her peers which is impossible

sighs

on earth
Well toast some heathen deity or celestial goddess to match her
Why then bumpers—bumpers all round —heres Maria—Maria—Sighs
Maria—Pshaw—give us her sir-name
Pshaw—hang her sir-name thats too formal to be registered on loves kalender
Maria then—heres Maria
Maria—come heres Maria
Come Sir Toby have a care you must give a beauty superlative
Then Ill give you—Heres—
Nay never hesitate—But Sir Toby has got a song that will excuse him
The song—The song
SONG
Heres to the maiden of blushing fifteen
Now to the widow of fifty
Heres to the flaunting extravagant quean
And then to the house-wife thats thrifty
Let the toast pass drink to the lass
I warrant shell find an excuse for the glass
Heres to the charmer whose dimples we prize
Now to the damsel with none sir
Heres to the maid with her pair of blue eyes
And now to the nymph with but one sir
Let the toast pass &c
Heres to the maid with her bosom of snow
Now to her thats as brown as a berry
Heres to the wife with her face full of woe
And now to the damsel thats merry
Let the toast pass &c
For let them be clumsy or let them be slim
Young or ancient I care not a feather
So fill us a bumper quite up to the brim
And een let us toast them together
Let the toast pass &c

enters and whispers
CHARLES
Gentlemen I must beg your pardon

rising

I must leave you upon business—Careless take the chair
What this is some wench—but we wont lose you for her
No upon my honour—It is only a Jew and a broker that are come by appointment
A Jew and a broker well have em in
Then desire Mr Moses to walk in
And little Premium too Sir
Aye Moses and Premium

Exit Trip

Charles well give the rascals some generous Burgundy
No hang it—wine but draws forth the natural qualities of a mans heart and to make them drink would only be to whet their knavery

MOSES
Walk in Gentlemen walk in Trip give chairs sit down Mr Premium sit down Moses Glasses Trip come Moses Ill give you a sentiment 
Heres success to usury
 Moses fill the gentleman a bumper
Heres success to usury
True Charles usury is industry and deserves to succeed
Then heres All the success it deserves
Oh damme sir that wont do you demur to the toast and shall drink it in a pint bumber at least
Oh sir consider Mr Premium is a gentleman
And therefore loves good wine and Ill see justice done to the bottle—Fill Moses a quart
Pray consider gentlemen Mr Premium is a stranger
I wish I was out of their company
Aside
Come along my boys if they wont drink with us well not stay with them the dice are in the next room—Youll settle your business Charles and come to us
Aye aye—but Careless you must be ready perhaps I may have occasion for you
Aye aye bill bond or annuity tis all the same to me
Exit with the rest
Mr Premium is a gentleman of the strictect honour and secrecy and always performs what he undertakes— Mr Premium this is—

formally

Pshaw hold your tongue—my friend Moses sir is a very honest fellow but a little slow at expression—I shall cut the matter very short— Im an extravagant young fellow that wants to borrow money and you as I take it are a prudent old fellow who has got money to lend—I am such a fool as to give fifty per cent rather than go without it and you I suppose are rogue enough to take an hundred if you can get it And now we understand one another and may proceed to business without further ceremony
Exceeding frank upon my word I see you are not a man of compliments
No Sir
Sir I like you the better for it—However you are mistaken in one thing I have no money to lend but I believe I could procure you some from a friend but then hes a damnd unconscionable dog is he not Moses
Yes but you cant help that
And then he has not the money by him▪ but must sell stock at a great loss must not he Moses
Yes indeed—you know I always speak the truth and scorn to tell a lye
Aye those who speak truth usually do— And Sir I must pay the difference I suppose—Why lookye Mr Premium I know that money is not to be had without paying for it
Well—but what security could you give—you have not any land I suppose
Not a mole-hill nor a twig but what grows in bow-pots out at the windows
Nor any stock I presume
None but live stock and they are only a few pointers and ponies—But pray Sir are you acquainted with any of my connections
To say the truth I am
Then you must have heard that I had a rich old uncle in India Sir Oliver Surface from whom I have the greatest expectations
That you have a wealthy uncle I have heard but how your expectations will turn out is more I believe than you can tell
Oh yes Im told I am a monstrous favourite and that he intends leaving me every thing
Indeed this is the first I have heard of it
Yes yes he intends making me his heir —Does he not Moses
Oh yes Ill take my oath of that
Egad theyll persuade me presently that I am in Bengal
Aside
Now what I propose Mr Premium is to give you a
post obiit
on my uncles life Though indeed my uncle Noll has been very kind to me and upon my soul I shall be sincerely sorry to hear any thing has happened to him
Not more than I should I assure you But the bond you mention happens to be the worst security you could offer me for I might live to be an hundred and never recover the principal
Oh yes you would for the moment he dies you come upon me for the money
Then I believe I would be the most unwelcome dun you ever had in your life
What you are afraid my little Premium that my uncle is too good a life
No indeed I am not though I have heard hes as hale and as hearty as any man of his years in Christendom
Oh there you are misinformed No—no poor uncle Oliver he breaks a pace The climate sir has hurt his constitution and Im told hes so much altered of late that his nearest relations dont know him
No ha ha ha so much altered of late that his relations would not know him Ha ha ha thats droll egad
What you are pleased to hear hes on the decline my little Premium
No I am not—no no no
Yes you are for it mends your chance
But I am told Sir Oliver is coming over—nay some say he is actually arrived
Oh there you are misinformed again— No—no such thing—he is this moment in Bengal What I must certainly know better than you
Very true as you say you must know better than I though I have it from very good authority— Have I not Moses
Most undoubtedly
But Sir as I understand you want a few hundreds immediately is there nothing that you would dispose of
How do you mean
For instance now I have heard your father left behind him a great quantity of massy old plate
Yes but that is gone long ago—Moses can inform you how better than I can
Good lack all the family race cups and corporation bowls gone

Aside

It was also supposed that his library was one of the most valuable and compleat
Much too large and valuable for a private gentleman for my part I was always of a communicative disposition and thought it a pity to keep so much knowledge to myself
Mercy on me knowledge that has run in the family like a heir-loom

Aside

And pray how may they have been disposed of
Oh you must ask the auctioneer that— I dont believe even Moses can direct you there
No—I never meddle with books
The profligate

Aside

And is there nothing you can dispose of
Nothing—unless you have a taste for old family pictures I have a whole room full of ancestors above stairs
Why sure you would not sell your relations
Every soul of them to the best bidder
Not your great uncles and aunts
Aye and my grandfathers and grandmothers
Ill never forgive him this

Aside

Why—what—Do you take me for Shylock in the play to raise money from me on your own flesh and blood
Nay dont be in a passion my little Premium what is it to you if you have your moneys worth
Thats very true as you say—Well well I believe I can dispose of the family canvass Ill never forgive him this

With all my heart I handle a hammer as well as a dice box—a-going—a-going
Bravo—And Moses you shall be appraiser if we want one
Yes Ill be the appraiser

and
MOSES
WALK in gentlemen walk in here they are— the family of the Surfaces up to the Conquest
And in my opinion a good collection
Aye there they are done in the true spirit and style of portrait painting and not like your modern Raphaels who will make your picture independent of yourself—no the great merit of these are the inveterate likeness they bear to the originals All stiff and awkward as they were and like nothing in human nature besides
Oh we shall never see such figures of men again
I hope not—You see Mr Premium what a domestic man I am here I sit of an evening surrounded by my ancestors—But come let us proceed to business—To your pulpit Mr Auctioneer—Oh heres a great chair of my fathers that seems fit for nothing else
The very thing—but what shall I do for a hammer Charles an Auctioneer is nothing without a hammer
A hammer

looking round

lets see what have we here—Sir Richard heir to Robert—a genealogy in full egad—Here Careless you shall have no common bit of monogany heres the family tree and now you may knock down my ancesters with their own pedigree
What an unnatural rogue he is— An expert facto paracide

Aside

Gad Charles this is lucky for it will not only serve for a hammer but a catalogue too if we should want it
True—Come heres my great uncle Sir Richard Ravelin a marvelous good General in his day—he served in all the Duke of Marlboroughs wars and got that cut over his eye at the battle of Malplaquet—He is not dressed out in feathers like our modern captains but enveloped in wig and regimentals as a General should be—What say you Mr Premium
Mr Premium would have you speak
Why you shall have him for ten pounds and Im sure thats cheap enough for a staff officer
Heaven deliver me his great uncle Sir Richard going for ten pounds—

Aside

—Well sir I take him at that price
Careless knock down my uncle Richard
Going going—a going—gone
This is a maiden sister of his my great aunt Deborah done by Kneller thought to be one of his best pictures and esteemed a very formidable likeness There she sits as a shepherdess feeding her flock—You shall have her for five pounds ten Im sure the sheep are worth the money
Ah poor aunt Deborah a woman that set such a value on herself going for five pounds ten—

Aside

—Well sir shes mine
Knock down my aunt Deborah Careless
Gone
Here are two cousins of theirs—Moses these pictures were done when beaux wore perewigs and ladies their own hair
Yes truly—head-dresses seem to have been somewhat lower in those days
Heres a grandfather of my mothers a judge well known on the western circuit What will you give for him
Four guineas
Four guineas why you dont bid the price of his wig Premium you have more respect for the Wool Sack do let me knock him down at fifteen
By all means
Gone
Here are two brothers William and Walter Blunt Esquires both members of Parliament and great speakers and whats very extraordinary I believe this is the first time they were ever bought or sold
Thats very extraordinary indeed— Ill take them at your own price for the honour of Parliament
Well said Premium
Ill knock em down at forty pounds— Going—going—gone
Heres a jolly portly fellow I dont know what relation he is to the family but he was formerly Mayor of Norwich lets knock him down at eight pounds
No I think six is enough for a Mayor
Come come make it guineas and Ill throw you the two Aldermen into the bargain
They are mine
Careless knock down the Mayor and Aldermen
Gone
But hang it we shall be all day at this rate come come give me three hundred pounds and take all on this side the room in a lump— And that will be the best way
Well well any thing to accommodate you they are mine—But there is one portrait you have always passed over
What that little ill-looking fellow over the settee
Yes Sir tis that I mean—but I dont think him so ill-looking a fellow by any means
Thats the picture of my uncle Oliver— before he went abroad it was done and is esteemed a very great likeness
That your uncle Oliver Then in my opinion you will never be friends for he is one of the most stern looking rogues I ever beheld he has an unforgiving eye and a damnd disinheriting countenance Dont you think so little Premium
Upon my soul I do not Sir I think it as honest a looking face as any in the room dead or alive—But I suppose your uncle Oliver goes with the rest of the lumber
No hang it the old gentleman has been very good to me and Ill keep his picture as long as I have a room to put it in
The rogues my nephew after all—I forgive him every thing

Aside

but Sir I have some how taken a fancy to that picture
I am sorry for it Master Broker for you certainly wont have it—What the devil have you not got enough of the family
I forgive him every thing

Aside

Look Sir I am a strange sort of a fellow and when I take a whim in my head I dont value money Ill give you as much for that as for all the rest
Praythee dont be troublesome—I tell you I wont part with it and theres an end ont

Peremtorily
Ah the dear extravagant dog

Aside

Good day Sir Come Moses—Now let me see who dares call him profligate
Exit with Moses
Why Charles this is the very prince of Brokers
I wonder where Moses got acquainted with so honest a fellow—But Careless step into the company Ill wait on you presently I see old Rowley coming
But harkye Charles dont let that fellow make you part with any of that money to discharge musty old debts Tradesmen you know are the most impertinent people in the world
True and paying them would only be encouraging them
Well settle your business and make what haste you can

ROWLEY
Ah old Rowley you are just come in time to take leave of your old acquaintance
Yes sir I heard they were going—But how can you express such spirits under all your misfortunes
Thats the cause Master Rowley my misfortunes are so many that I cant afford to part with my spirits
And can you really take leave of your ancestors with so much unconcern
Unconcern what I suppose you are surprized that I am not mere sorrowful at losing the company of so many worthy friends It is very distressing to be sure but you see they never move a muscle then why the devil should I
Ah dear Charles—
But come I have no time for trifling— here take this bill and get it changed and carry an hundred pounds to poor Stanley or we shall have somebody call that has a better right to it
Ah Sir I wish you would remember the proverb—

be just before you are generous
— Why fool would if I could but justice is an old lame hobbling beldame and I cant get her to keep pace with generosity for the soul of me
Do dear Sir reflect
Thats very true as you say—but Rowley while I have by Heavens Ill give—so damn your morality and away to old Stanley with the money
Exeunt
And enter Sir
OLIVER
and
MOSES
Well Sir I think as Sir Peter said you have seen Mr Charles in all his glory—tis great pity hes so extravagant
True but he would not sell my picture—
And loves wine and women so much
But he would not sell my picture—
And games so deep
But he would not sell my picture— Oh here comes Rowley
Enter
ROWLEY
Well Sir I find you have made a purchase
Yes our young rake has parted with his ancestors like tapestry
And he has commissioned me to return you an hundred pounds of the purchase money but under your fictitious character of old Stanley I saw a taylor and two nosiers dancing attendance who I know will go unpaid and the two hundred pounds would just satisfy them
Well well Ill pay his debts and his benevolence too—But now Im no more a broker and you shall introduce me to the elder brother as old Stanley

JOSEPH and a SERVANT
NO letter from Lady Teazle
No Sir
I wonder she did not write if she could not come—I hope Sir Peter does not suspect me—but Charless dissipation and extravagance are great points in my favour

knocking at the door

—see if it is her
Tis Lady Teazle sir but she always orders her chair to the milliners in the next street
Then draw that screen—my opposite neighbour is a maiden Lady of so curious a temper—you need not wait

Exit servant

—My Lady Teazle Im afraid begins to suspect my attachment to Maria but she must not be acquainted with that secret till I have her more in my power
Enter Lady
TEAZLE
What sentiment in soliloquy—Have you been very impatient now Nay you look so grave—I assure you I came as soon as I could
Oh madam punctuallity is a species of constancy—a very unfashionable custom among ladies
Nay now you wrong me Im sure youd pity me if you knew my situation—

both sit

— Sir Peter grows so peevish and so ill natured theres no enduring him and then to suspect me with Charles—
Im glad my scandalous friends keep up that report
Aside
For my part I wish Sir Peter to let Maria marry him—Woudnt you Mr Surface

Aside

Indeed I would not—Oh to be sure and then my dear Lady Teazle would be convinced how groundless her suspicions were of my having any thoughts of the silly girl
Then theres my friend Lady Sneerwell has propagated malicious stories about me—and whats very provoking all too without the least foundation
Ah theres the mischief for when a scandalous story is believed against me theres no comfort like the consciousness of having deserved it
And to be continually censured and suspected when I know the integrity of my own heart—it would almost prompt me to give him some grounds for it
Certainly for when a husband grows suspicious and withdraws his confidence from his wife it then becomes a part of her duty to endeavour to out wit him—You owe it to the natural privilege of your sex
Indeed
Oh yes for your husband should never be deceived in you and you ought to be frail in compliment to his discernment
This is the newest doctrine
Very wholesome believe me
So the only way to prevent his suspicions is to give him cause for them
Certainly
But then the consciousness of my innocence—
Ah my dear lady Teazle tis that consciousness of your innocence that ruins you—What is it that makes you imprudent in your conduct and careless of the censures of the world The consciousness of your innocence—What is it makes you regardless of forms and inattentive to your husbands peace Why the consciousness of your innocence—Now my dear Lady Teazel if you could only be prevailed upon to make a trifling
faux pas
you cant imagine how circumspect you would grow
Do you think so
Depend upon it—Your case at present my dear Lady Teazle resembles that of a person in a plethora—you are absolutely dying of too much health
Why indeed if my understanding could be convinced
Your understanding—Oh yes your understanding
should
be convinced Heaven forbid that I should persuade you to any thing that is wrong No no I have too much honour for that
Dont you think you may as well leave honour out of the question

both rise

Ah I see Lady Teazle the effects of country education still remain
They do indeed and I begin to find myself imprudent and if I should be brought to act wrong it would be sooner from Sir Peters ill treatment of me than from your honourable logic I assure you
Then by this hand which is unworthy—

knowing a servant enters

—What do you want you scoundrell
I beg pardon sir—I thought you would not chuse Sir Peter should come up
Sir Peter
Sir Peter Oh Im undone—What shall I do Hide me somewhere good Mr Logic
Here here behind this screen

she runs behind the screen

and now reach me a book

Sits down and reads

Enter Sir
PETER
Aye there he is ever improving himself —Mr Surface Mr Surface

Affecting to gape

Oh Sir Peter—I rejoice to see you—I was got over a sleepy book here— I am vastly glad to see you—I thank you for this call— I believe you have not been here since I finished my library—Books books you know are the only thing I am a coxcomb in
Very pretty indeed—why even your screen is a source of knowledge—hung round with maps I see
Yes I find great use in that screen
Yes yes so you must when you want to find any thing in a hurry
Yes or to hide any thing in a hurry
Aside
But my dear friend I want to have some private talk with you
You need not wait
Exit servant
Pray sit down—

both sit

—My dear friend I want to impart to you some of my distresses— In short Lady Teazles behaviour of late has given me very great uneasiness She not only dissipates and destroys my fortune but I have strong reasons to believe she has formed an attachment elsewhere
I am unhappy to hear it
Yes and between you and me I believe I have discovered the person
You alarm me exceedingly
I know you would sympathize with me
Believe me Sir Peter such a discovery would affect me—just as much as it does you
What a happiness to have a friend we can trust even with our family secrets—Cant you guess who it is
I havnt the most distant idea—It cant be Sir Benjamin Backbite
No no—What do you think of Charles
My brother impossible—I cant think he would be guilty of such baseness and ingratitude
Ah the goodness of your own mind makes you slow to believe such villainy
Very true Sir Peter—The man who is conscious of his own integrity of heart is very slow to credit anothers baseness
And yet that the son of my old friend should practise against the honour of my family
Aye theres the case Sir Peter—when ingratitude barbs the dart of injury the wound feels double smart
What noble sentiments—He never used a sentiment ungrateful boy that I acted as guardian to and who was brought up under my eye and I never in my life refused him—my advice
I dont know Sir Peter—he may be such a man—if it be so he is no longer a brother of mine I renounce him I disclaim him—For the man who can break through the laws of hospitality and seduce the wife or daughter of his friend deserves to be branded as a pest to society
And yet Joseph if I was to make it public I should only be sneered and laughed at
Why thats very true—No no you must not make it public people would talk—
Talk—Theyd say it was all my own fault an old doating batchelor to marry a young giddy girl Theyd paragraph me in the news-papers and make ballads on me
And yet Sir Peter I cant think that my Lady Teazles honour—
Ah my good friend whats her honour opposed against the flattery of a handsome young fellow—But Joseph she has been upbraiding me of late that I have not made her a settlement and I think in our last quarrel she told me she should not be very sorry if I was dead Now I have drafts of two deeds for your perusal and she shall find if I was to die that I have not been inattentive to her welfare while living By the one she will enjoy eight hundred pounds a year during my life and by the other the bulk of my fortune after my death
This conduct is truly generous—I wish it maynt corrupt my pupil
Aside
But I would not have her as yet acquainted with the least mark of my affection
Nor I—if you could help it
And now I have unburthened myself to you let us talk over your affair with Maria
Not a syllable upon the subject now

alarmed

—Some other time I am too much affected by your affairs to think of my own For the man who can think of his own happiness while his friend is in distress deserves to be hunted as a monster to society
I am sure of your affection for her
Let me intreat you Sir Peter—
And though you are so averse to Lady Teazles knowing it I assure you she is not your enemy and I am sensibly chagrined you have made no furthur progress
Sir Peter I must not hear you—The man who—

enter servant

What do you want sirrah
Your brother sir is at the door talking to a Gentleman he says he knows you are at home that Sir Peter is with you and he must see you
Im not at home
Yes yes you shall be at home

after some hesitation

Very well let him come up
Exit servant
Now Joseph Ill hide myself and do you tax him about the affair with my Lady Teazle and so draw the secret from him
O fie Sir Peter—what join in a plot to trepan my brother
Oh aye to serve your friend—besides if he is innocent as you say he is it will give him an opportunity to clear himself and make me very happy Hark I hear him coming—Where shall I go Behind this screen—What the devil here has been one listner already for Ill swear I saw a petticoat

Affecting to laugh

Its very ridiculous ha ha ha—a ridiculous affair indeed—ha ha ha Hark ye Sir Peter

pulling him aside

though I hold a man of intrigue to be a most despicable character yet you know it does not follow that one is to be an absolute Joseph either Hark ye tis a little French milliner who calls upon me sometimes and hearing you were coming and having some character to loose she sliped behind the screen
A French milliner

smiling

cunning rogue Joseph—fly rogue—But zounds she has over heard every thing that has passed about my wife
Oh never fear—Take my word it will never go farther for her
Wont it
No depend upon it
Well well if it will go no farther— but—where shall I hide myself
Here here slip into this closet and you may over hear every word
Can I steal away
Peeping
Hush hush dont stir
Joseph tax him home
Peeping
In my dear Sir Peter
Cant you lock the closet door
Not a word—Youll be discovered
Joseph dont spare him
For Heavens sake lie close—A pretty situation I am in to part man and wife in this manner
Aside
Youre sure the little French Milliner wont blab
Enter
CHARLES
Why how now brother your fellow denied you they said you were not at home—What have you had a Jew wench with you
Neither brother neither
But wheres Sir Peter I thought he was with you
He was brother but hearing you was coming he left the house
What was the old fellow afraid I wanted to borrow money of him
Borrow no brother but Im sorry to hear you have given that worthy man cause for great uneasiness
Yes I am told I do that to a great many worthy men—But how do you mean brother
Why he thinks you have endavoured to alienate the affections of Lady Teazle
Who I alienate the affections of Lady Teazle—Upon my word he accuses me very unjustly What has the old gentleman found out that he has got a young wife or what is worse has the Lady found out that she has got an old husband
For shame brother
Tis true I did once suspect her Ladyship had a partiality for me but upon my soul I never gave her the least encouragement for you know my attachment was to Maria
This will make Sir Peter extremely happy —But if she had a partiality for you sure you would not have been base enough—
Why look ye Joseph I hope I shall never deliberately do a dishonourable action but if a pretty woman should purposely throw herself in my way and as that pretty woman should happen to be married to a man old enough to be her father—
What then
Why then I believe I should—have occasion to borrow a little of your morality brother
Oh fie brother—The man who can jest—
Oh thats very true as you were going to observe—But Joseph do you know that I am surprized at your suspecting me with Lady Teazle I thought you was always the favourite there
Me—
Why yes I have seen you exchange such significant glances
Pshaw
Yes I have and dont you remember when I came in here and caught her and you at—
I must stop him

Aside
 
Stops his mouth

Sir Peter has over-heard every word that you have said
Sir Peter where is he—What in the closet—Foregad Ill have him out
No no

Stopping him

I will—Sir Peter Teazle come into court

Enter Sir Peter

What my old guardian turn inquisitor and take evidence incog
Give me your hand—I own my dear boy I have suspected you wrongfully but you must not be angry at Joseph it was all my plot and I shall think of you as long I live for what I overheard
Then tis well you did not hear more Is it not Joseph
What you would have retorted on Joseph would you
And yet you might as well have suspected him as me Might not he Joseph
Enter
SERVANT

Whispering Joseph

—Lady Sneerwell sir is just coming up and says she must see you
Gentlemen I must beg your pardon I have company waiting for me give me leave to conduct you down stairs
No no speak to em in another room I have not seen Sir Peter a great while and I want to talk with him
Well Ill send away the person and return immediately Sir Peter not a word of the little French Milliner
Exit
Ah Charles what a pity it is you dont associate more with your brother we might then have some hopes of your reformation hes a young man of such sentiments—Ah theres nothing in the world so noble as a man of sentiment
Oh hes too moral by half and so apprehensive of his good name that I dare say he would as soon let a priest into his house as a wench
No no you accuse him wrongfully— Though Joseph is not a rake he is no saint
Oh a perfect anchorite—a young hermit
Hush hush dont abuse him or he may chance to hear of it again
Why you wont tell him will you
No no but—I have a great mind to tell him

Aside

—
seems to hesitate

—Harkye Charles have you a mind for a laugh at Joseph
I should like it of all things—lets have it
Gad Ill tell him—Ill be even with Joseph for discovering me in the closet—

Aside

— Harkye Charles he had a girl with him when I called
Who Joseph impossible
Yes a little French Milliner

takes him to the front

and the best of the joke is she is now in the room
The devil she is—Where
Hush hush—behind the screen
Ill have her out
No no no no
Yes
No
By the Lord I will—So now fort
Both run up to the screen—screen falls at the same time
JOSEPH
enters
Lady Teazle by all thats wonderful
Lady Teazle by all thats horrible
Sir Peter this is the smartest French milliner I ever saw But pray whats the meaning of all this You seem to have been playing at hide and seek here and for my part I dont know whos in or whos out of the secret—Madam will you please to explain —Not a word—Brother is it your pleasure to illustrate —Morality dum too—Well though I can make nothing of it I suppose you can perfectly understand one another good folks and so Ill leave you Brother I am sorry you have given that worthy man so much cause for uneasiness—Sir Peter theres nothing in the world so noble as a man of sentiment— Ha ha ha
Exit
Sir Peter notwithstanding appearances are against me—if—if youll give me leave—Ill explain every thing to your satisfaction
If you please sir
Lady Teazle knowing any—Lady Teazle— I say—knowing my pretensions—to your ward—Maria —and—Lady Teazle—I say—knowing the jealousy of my—of your temper—she called in here— in order that she—that I—might explain—what these pretensions were—And—hearing you were coming— and—as I said before—knowing the jealousy of your temper—she—my Lady Teazle—I say—went behind the screen—and—This is a full and clear account of the whole affair
A very clear account truly and I dare say the lady will vouch for the truth of every word of it

Advancing

For not one syllable Sir Peter
What the devil dont you think it worth your while to agree in the lie
Theres not one word of truth in what that Gentleman has been saying
Zounds madam you wont ruin me
Stand out of the way Mr Hypocrite Ill speak for myself
Aye aye—let her alone—shell make a better story of it than you did
I came here with no intention of listening to his addresses to Maria and even ignorant of his pretensions but seduced by his insidious arts at least to listen to his addresses if not to sacrifice his honour as well as my own to his unwarrantable desires
Now I believe the truth is coming indeed
What is the woman mad
No sir she has recovered her senses Sir Peter I cannot expect you will credit me but the tenderness you expressed for me when I am certain you did not know I was within hearing has penetrated so deep into my soul that could I have escaped the mortification of this discovery my future life should have convinced you of my sincere repentance As for that smooth tongued hypocrite who would have seduced the wife of his too credulous friend while he pretended an honourable passion for his ward I now view him in so despicable a light that I shall never again respect myself for having listened to his addresses
Exit
Sir Peter—Notwithstanding all this— Heaven is my witness—
That you are a villain—and so Ill leave you to your meditations—
Nay Sir Peter you must not leave me— The man who shuts his ears against conviction—
Oh damn your sentiments—damn your sentiments

They let him in before I knew of it and old Rowley is with him
Pshaw you blockhead I am so distracted with my own misfortunes I am not in a humour to speak to any one—but shew the fellow up 
Exit servant
 Sure fortune never played a man of my policy such a trick before—my character ruined with Sir Peter—my hopes of Maria lost—Im in a pretty humour to listen to poor relations truly—I shant be be able to bestow even a benevolent sentiment on old Stanley Oh here he comes Ill retire and endeavour to put a little charity in my face however
Exit
Enter Sir
OLIVER
and
ROWLEY
What does he avoid us That was him was it not
Yes sir but his nerves are too weak to bear the sight of a poor relation I should have come first to break the matter to him
A plague of his nerves—yet this is he whom Sir Peter extols as a man of a most benevolent way of thinking
Yes he has as much speculative benevolence as any man in the kingdom though he is not so sensual as to indulge himself in the exercise of it
Yet he has a string of sentiments I suppose at his fingers ends
And his favourite one is
that charity begins at home
And his I presume is of that domestic sort which never stirs abroad at all
Well sir Ill leave you to introduce yourself as old Stanley I must be here again to announce you in your real character
True and youll afterwards meet me at Sir Peters
Without losing a moment
Exit Rowley
Here he comes—I dont like the complaisance of his features
Enter
JOSEPH
Sir your most obedient I beg pardon for keeping you a moment—Mr Stanley I presume
At your service sir
Pray be seated Mr Stanley I intreat you sir
Dear sir theres no occasion Too ceremonious by half
Aside
Though I have not the pleasure of your acquaintance I am very glad to see you look so well —I think Mr Stanley you was nearly related to my mother
I was sir so nearly that my present poverty I fear may do discredit to her wealthy children else I would not presume to trouble you now
Ah sir dont mention that—For the man who is in distress has ever a right to claim kindred with the wealthy I am sure I wish I was of that number or that it was in my power to afford you even a small relief
If your uncle Sir Oliver was here I should have a friend
I wish he was you should not want an advocate with him believe me
I should not need one my distresses would recommend me But I imagined his bounty had enabled you to be the agent of his charities
Ah sir you are mistaken avarice avarice Mr Stanley is the vice of age to be sure it has been spread abroad that he has been very bountiful to me but without the least foundation though I never chose to contradict the report
And has he never remitted you bullion rupees or pagodas
Oh dear sir no such thing I have indeed received some trifling presents from him such as shawls avadavats and Indian crackers nothing more sir
Theres gratitude for twelve thousand pounds

Aside

Shawls avadavats and Indian crackers
Then theres my brother Mr Stanley one would scarce believe what I have done for that unfortunate young man
Not I for one

Aside

Oh the sums I have lent him—Well twas an amiable weakness—I must own I cant defend it though it appears more blameable at present as it prevents me from serving you Mr Stanley as my heart directs
Dissembler—

Aside

—then you cannot assist me
I am very unhappy to say its not in my power at present but you may depend upon hearing from me when I can be of any service to you
Sweet sir you are too good
Not at all sir to pity without the power to relieve is still more painful than to ask and be denied Indeed Mr Stanley you have me deeply affected Sir your most devoted I wish you health and spirits
Your ever grateful and perpetual

humble servant
I am extremely sorry sir for your misfortunes— Here open the door—Mr Stanley your most devoted
Your most obliged servant Charles you are my heir
Aside and exit
This is another of the evils that attend a mans having so good a character—It subjects him to the importunity of the necessitous—the pure and sterling are of charity is a very expensive article in the catalogue of a mans virtues whereas the sentimental French plate I use answers the purpose full as well and pays no tax

Enter Sir
BENJAMIN BACKBITE
Oh Sir Benjamin I am glad you are come have you heard of Lady Teazles affair Well I never was so surprized—and I am so distressed for the parties
Nay I cant say I pity Sir Peter he was always so partial to Mr Surface
Mr Surface Why it was Charles
Oh no madam Mr Surface was the gallant
No Charles was the lover and Mr Surface to do him justice was the cause of the discovery he brought Sir Peter and—
Oh my dear madam no such thing for I had it from one—
Yes and I had it from one that had it from one that knew—
And I had it from one—
No such thing—But here comes my Lady Sneerwell and perhaps she may have heard the particulars
Enter Lady
SNEERWELL
Oh dear Mrs Candour here is a sad affair about our friend Lady Teazle
Why to be sure poor thing I am much concerned for her
I protest so am I—though I must confess she was always too lively for me
But she had a great deal of good nature
And had a very ready wit
But do you know all the particulars

To Lady Sneerwell

Yet who could have suspected Mr Surface
Charles you mean
No Mr Surface
Oh twas Charles
Charles
Yes Charles
Ill not pretend to dispute with you Mrs Candour but be it as it may I hope Sir Peters wounds wont prove mortal
Sir Peters wounds what did they fight I never heard a word of that
No—
No—
Nor I a syllable Do dear Sir Benjamin tell us
Oh My dear madam then you dont know half the affair—Why—why—Ill tell you— Sir Peter you must know had a long time suspected Lady Teazles visits to Mr Surface
To Charles you mean
No Mr Surface—and upon going to his house and finding Lady Teazle there sir says Sir Peter you are a very ungrateful fellow
Aye that was Charles
Mr Surface—And old as I am says he I demand immediate satisfaction upon this they both drew their swords and to it they sell
That must be Charles for it is very unlikely that Mr Surface should fight him in his own house
Sdeath madam not at all Lady Teazle upon seeing Sir Peter in such danger ran out of the room in strong hysteries and was followed by Charles calling out for hartshorn and water They fought and Sir Peter received a wound in his right side by the thrust of a small sword

CRABTREE
Pistols Pistols Nephew
Oh Mr Crabtree I am glad you are come now we shall have the whole affair
No no it was a small sword uncle
Zounds nephew I say it was a pistol
A thrust in second through the small guts
A bullet lodged in the thorax
But give me leave dear uncle it was a small sword
I tell you it was a pistol—Wont you suffer any body to know any thing but yourself— It was a pistol and Charles—
Aye I knew it was Charles
Mr Surface uncle
Why zounds I say it was Charles must no body speak but yourself Ill tell you how the whole affair was
Ah do do pray tell us
I see my uncle knows nothing at all about the matter
Mr Surface you must know Ladies came late from Salt-hill where he had been the evening before with a particular friend of his who has a son at Eton his pistols were left on the bureau and unfortunately loaded and on Sir Peters taxing Charles—
Mr Surface you mean
Do pray nephew hold your tongue and let me speak sometimes—I say Ladies upon his taking Charles to account and taxing him with the basest ingratitude—
Aye Ladies I told you Sir Peter taxed him with ingratitude
They agreed each to take a pistol— They fired at the same instant—Charless ball took place and lodged in the thorax Sir Peters missed and what is very extraordinary the ball grazed against a little bronze Shakespeare that stood over the chimney flew off through the window at right angles and wounded the post man who was just come to the door with a double letter from Northamptonshire
I heard nothing of all this I must own Ladies my uncles account is more circumstantial though mine is the true one
I am more interested in this affair than they imagine and must have better information
Aside and exit
Lady Sneerwells alarm is very easily accounted for
Why yes they do say—but thats neither here nor there
But pray where is Sir Peter now I hope his wound wont prove mortal
He was carried home immediately and has given positive orders to be denied to every body
And I believe Lady Teazle is attending him
I do believe so too
Certainly—I met one of the faculty as I came in
Gad so and here he comes
Yes yes thats the Doctor
That certainly must be the physician —Now we shall get information
Enter Sir
OLIVER SURFACE
Dear Doctor how is your patient
I hope his wounds are not mortal
Is he in a fair way of recovery
Pray Doctor was he not wounded by a thrust of a sword through the small guts
Was it not by a bullet that lodged in the thorax
Nay pray answer me
Dear dear Doctor speak
All pulling him
Hey hey good people are you all mad—Why what the devil is the matter—a sword through the small guts and a bullet lodged in the thorax What would you all be at
Then perhaps sir you are not a Doctor
If I am sir I am to thank you for my degree
Only a particular friend I suppose
Nothing more sir
Then I suppose as you are a friend you can be better able to give us some account of his wounds
Wounds
What havnt you heard he was wounded—The saddest accident
A thrust with a sword through the small guts
A bullet in the thorax
Good people speak one at a time I beseech you—You both agree that Sir Peter is dangerously wounded
Ay ay we both agree in that
Then I will be bold to say Sir Peter is one of the most imprudent men in the world for here he comes walking as if nothing had happened
Enter Sir
PETER
My good friend you are certainly mad to walk about in this condition you should go to bed you that have had a sword through your small guts and a bullet lodged in your thorax
A sword through my small guts and a bullet lodged in my thorax
Yes these worthy people would have killed you without law or physic and wanted to dub me a Doctor in order to make me an accomplice
What is all this
Sir Peter we are all very glad to find the story of the duel is not true
And exceedingly sorry for your other misfortunes
So so all over the town already
Aside
Though as Sir Peter was so good a husband I pity him sincerely
Plague of your pity
As you continued so long a batchelor you was certainly to blame to marry at all
Sir I desire youll consider this is my own house
However you must not be offended at the jests youll meet on this occasion
It is no uncommon case thats one thing
I insist upon being master here in plain terms I desire youll leave my house immediately
Well well sir we are going and you may depend upon it we shall make the best of the story

Aye Joseph is the man
Such sentiments
And acts up to the sentiments he professes
Oh tis edification to hear him talk
He is a pattern for the young men of the age—But how comes it Sir Peter that you dont join in his praises
Sir Oliver we live in a damned wicked world and the fewer we praise the better
Right right my old friend—But was you always so moderate in your judgement
Do you say so Sir Peter You never was mistaken in your life
Oh plague of your jokes—I suppose you are acquainted with the whole affair
I am indeed sir—I met Lady Teazle returning from Mr Surfaces so humbled that she deigned to beg even me to become here advocate
What does Sir Oliver know it too
Aye aye every circumstance
What about the closet and the screen
Yes and the little French milliner too I never laughed more in my life
And a very pleasant jest it was
This is your man of sentiment Sir Peter
Oh damn his sentiments
You must have made a pretty appearance when Charles dragged you out of the closet
Yes yes that was very diverting
And egad Sir Peter I should like to have seen your face when the screen was thrown down
My face when the screen was thrown down oh yes—Theres no bearing this

Aside

come come my old friend dont be vexed for I cant help laughing for the soul of me Ha ha ha
Oh laugh on—I am not vexed—no no it is the pleasantest thing in the world To be the standing jest of all ones acquaintance tis the happiest situation imaginable
See sir yonders my Lady Teazle coming this way and in tears let me beg of you to be reconciled
Well well Ill leave Rowley to mediate between you and take my leave but you must make haste after me to Mr Surfaces where I go if not to reclaim a libertine at least to expose hypocrisy
Exit
Ill be with you at the discovery I should like to see it though it is a vile unlucky place for discoveries Rowley

looking out

she is not coming this way
No sir but she has left the room door open and writs your coming
Well certainly mortification is very becoming in a wife—Dont you think I had better let her pine a little longer
Oh sir thats being too severe
I dont think so the letter I found from Charles was evidently intended for her
Indeed Sir Peter you are much mistaken
If I was convinced of that—see Master Rowley she looks this way—What a remarkable elegant turn of the head she has—I have a good mind to go to her
Do dear sir
But when it is known that we are reconciled▪ I shall be laughed at more than ever
Let them laugh on and retort their malice upon themselves by shewing them you can be happy in spite of their slander
Faith and so I will Master Rowley and my Lady Teazle and I may still be the happiest couple in the country
Oh fie Sir Peter he that lays aside suspicion—
My dear Rowley if you have any regard for me never let me hear you utter any thing like a sentiment again I have had enough of that to last me the remainder of my life
Exeunt
SCENE JOSEPHS Library
Enter
JOSEPH
and Lady
SNEERWELL
Impossible Will not Sir Peter be immediately reconciled to Charles and no longer oppose his union with Maria
Can passion mend it
No nor cunning neither I was a fool to league with such a blunderer
Sure my Lady Sneerwell I am the greatest sufferer in this affair and yet you see I bear it with calmness
Because the disappointment does not reach your heart your interest only was concerned Had you felt for Maria what I do for that unfortunate libertine your brother you would not be dissuaded from taking every revenge in your power
Why will you rail at me for the disappointment
Are you not the cause Had you not a sufficient field for your roguery in imposing upon Sir Peter and supplanting your brother but you must endeavour to seduce his wife I hate such an avarice of crimes tis an unfair monopoly and never prospers
Well I own I am to blame—I have deviated from the direct rule of wrong Yet I cannot think circumstances are so bad as your Ladyship apprehends
No
You tell me you have made another trial of Snake that he still proves steady to our interest and that he is ready if occasion requires to swear to a contract having passed between Charles and your Ladyship
And what then
Why the letters which have been so carefully circulated will corroborate his evidence and prove the truth of the assertion But I expect my uncle every moment and must beg your Ladyship to retire into the next room
But if he should find you out
I have no fear of that—Sir Peter wont tell for his own sake and I shall soon find out Sir Olivers weak side
Nay I have no doubt of your abilities▪ only be constant to one villainy at a time
Well I will I will—

Exit Lady Sneerwell

—It is confounded hard though to be baited by ones confederate in wickedness—

knocking
—Who have we got here My uncle Oliver I suppose—Oh old Stanley again How came he here He must not stay—
Enter Sir
OLIVER
I told you already Mr Stanley that it was not in my power to relieve you
But I hear sir that Sir Oliver is arrived and perhaps he might
Well sir you cannot stay now sir but any other time sir you shall certainly be relieved
h Sir Oliver and I must be acquainted
I
upon your going Indeed Mr
 you cant stay
Positively I must see Sir Oliver
Then positively you shant stay
Pushing him out
Enter
CHARLES
Hey day whats the matter Why who the devil have we got here What my little Premium Oh brother you must not hurt my little broker But harkye Joseph what have you been borrowing money too
Borrowing money no brother—We expect my uncle Oliver here every minute and Mr Stanley insists upon seeing him
Stanley Why his name is Premium
No no I tell you his name is Stanley
But I tell you again his name is Premium
It dont signify what his name is
No more it dont as you say brother for I suppose he goes by half a hundred names besides A B at the Coffee-houses But old Noll must not come and catch my little broker here neither
Mr Stanley I beg—
And I beg Mr Premium—
You must go indeed Mr Stanley
Aye you must go Mr Premium
Both pushing him
Enter Sir
PETER
Lady
TEAZLE MARIA
and
ROWLEY
What my old friend Sir Oliver whats the matter—In the name of wonder were there ever two such ungracious nephews to assault their uncle at his first visit
On my word sir it was well we came to your rescue
Charles
Joseph
Now our ruin is complete
Very
You find Sir Oliver your necessitous character of old Stanley could not protect you
No nor Premium neither The necessities of the former could not extract a shilling from that benevolent Gentleman there and with the other I stood a worse chance than my ancestors and had like to have been knocked down without being bid for Sir Peter my friend and Rowley look upon that elder Nephew of mine▪ you both know what I have done for him and how gladly I would have looked upon half my fortune as held only in trust for him Judge then of my surprise and disappointment at finding him destitute of truth charity and gratitude
Sir Oliver I should be as much surprised as you if I did not already know him to be artful selfish and hypocritical
And if he pleads not guilty to all this let him call upon me to finish his character
Then I believe we need not add more for if he knows himself it will be a sufficient punishment for him that he is known by the world
If they talk this way to honesty what will they say to me by and by
Aside
As for that profligate there—
pointing to Charles
Ay now comes my turn the damnd family pictures will ruin me
Aside
Sir Oliver will you honour me with a hearing
Now if Joseph would make one of his long speeches I should have time to recollect myself
Aside
I suppose you would undertake to justify yourself entirely
I trust I could Sir
Pshaw

turns away from him

and I suppose you could justify yourself too
To Charles
Not that I know of sir
What my little Premium was let too much into the secret
Why yes sir but they were family secrets and should go no further
Come come sir Oliver I am sure you cannot look upon Charless follies with anger
No nor with gravity neither—Do you know sir Peter the young rogue has been selling me his ancestors I have bought judges and staff officers by the foot and maiden aunts as cheap as old china

During this speech Charles laughs behind his hat

Why that I have made free with the family canvas is true my ancestors may rise in judgment against me theres no denying it but believe me when I tell you and upon my soul I would not say it if it was not so if I dont appear mortified at the exposure of my follies it is because I feel at this moment the warmest satisfaction at seeing you my liberal benefactor

embraces him

Charles I forgive you give me your hand again the little ill-looking fellow over the settee has made your peace for you
Then sir my gratitude to the original is still increased
Sir Oliver here is another with whom I dare say Charles is no less anxious to be reconciled
I have heard of that attachment before and with the Ladys leave—if I construe right that blush—
Well child speak for yourself
I have little more to say than that I wish him happy and for any influence I might once have had over his affections I most willingly resign them to one who has a better claim to them
Hey whats the matter now While he was a rake and a profligate you would hear of nobody else and now that he is likely to reform you wont have him Whats the meaning of all this
His own heart and Lady Sneerwell can best inform you
Lady Sneerwell
I am very sorry brother I am obliged to speak to this point but justice demands it from me and Lady Sneerwells wrongs can no longer be concealed
Enter Lady
SNEERWELL
Another French milliner—I believe he has one in every room in the house
Ungrateful Charles Well you may seem confounded and surprized at the indelicate situation to which your perfidy has reduced me
Pray uncle is this another of your plots for as I live this is the first I ever heard of it
There is but one witness I believe necessary to the business
And that witness is Mr Snake—you were perfectly in the right in bringing him with you

Desire Mr Snake to walk in—It is rather unlucky madam that he should be brought to confront and not support your Ladyship
Enter
SNAKE
I am surprized what speak villain have you too conspired against me
I beg your Ladyship ten thousand pardons I must own you paid me very liberally for the lying questions but I have unfortunately been offered double for speaking the truth
Plot and counter-plot—I give your Ladyship much joy of your negociation
May the torments of despair and disappointment light upon you all

going

Hold Lady Sneerwell before you go give me leave to return you thanks
or the trouble you and this gentleman took in writing letters in my name to Charles and answering them yourself— and at the same time I must beg you will present my compliments to the scandalous college of which you are president and inform them that Lady Teazle licentiate returns the diploma they granted her as she leaves off practice and kills characters no longer
You too madam Provoking insolent may your husband live these fifty years
Exit
Oh Lord—what a malicious creature it is
Not for her last wish I hope
Oh no no no
Well sir—what have you to say for yourself

to Joseph

Sir I am so confounded that Lady Sneerwell should impose upon us all by suborning Mr Snake that I know not what to say—but—lest her malice should prompt her to injure my brother— I had better follow her
Exit
Moral to the last
Marry her Joseph marry her if you can—Oil and Vinegar—youll do very well together
Mr Snake I believe we have no further occasion for you
Well—averse to sentiments as I am yet I cannot help observing that when a knave succeeds in his designs upon credulity he can boast of nothing more than having been a while mistaken for an honest man but it would be better for the continuance and completion of his happiness were he to become for life and in reality what he has only seemed to be

A DISCOURSE Concerning the ACTION OF THE SUN and MOON ON
Animal Bodies
AND The INFLUENCE which this may have in many Diseases

A DISCOURSE Concerning the ACTION of the SUN and MOON on
Animal Bodies
PART I
THAT some Diseases are properly the Effects of the Influence of the heavenly Bodies and that others do vary their Periods and Symptoms according to the different Positions of one or other of those luminous Globes is a very antient and certain Observation Upon this Score
Hippocrates
Epist ad Thessalum Filium
advises his Son
Thessalus
to the Study of Geometry and Numbers because
the Knowledge of the Stars is of very great Use in Physick
 De Aere Aquis & Locis
 And the earliest Histories of Epidemick Distempers particularly do all turn upon the Alterations made in our Bodies by the Heavens
But when in later Times Medicine came to be accommodated to the Reasonings of Philosophers no body being able to account for the Manner of this celestial Action it was allowed no farther Share in affecting our Health than what might be imputed to the Changes in the manifest Constitution of the Air excepting perhaps something of Truth which still remains disguised and blended with the Jargon of judiciary Astrology
In order therefore to set this Matter in a little clearer Light I shall in the first Place shew That the Sun and Moon regarding their Nearness and Direction to the Earth only besides the Effects of Heat Moisture
&c
thereby caused in our Atmosphere must at certain Times make some Alterations in all Animal Bodies then enumerate some Histories and Observations of such Changes and enquire of what Use such Thoughts as these may be in the Practice of Physick
It is a constant Observation of those who write the History of the
Winds
That the most windy Seasons of the Year are the Time about the Vernal and Autumnal Equinox for be the Air never so calm before or after we never fail of having Winds at that Juncture Every body likewise knows that in the most quiet Weather we are sure of some Breeze at Mid-day and Midnight as also at full Sea
i e
always about the Time the Sun or Moon arrive at the Meridian Seamen and Country People reckon upon this and order their Affairs accordingly And the Changes of the Weather as to Winds or Calms especially about the new and full Moon are too well known to require any Authority to confirm such Remarks Those who desire a fuller Account of these Observations may see it in
De Chales
s Navigation
Gassendus
s Natural Philosophy and
J Goad
his
Astro-Meteoro-Logica
These Things being Matters of Fact and in a Manner regular and universal it may very well seem strange that Philosophers have not been more accurate in their Enquiries into the Reason of such Appearances True indeed it is that the Origin of Winds is various and uncertain but however so constant and uniform an Effect must undoubtedly be owing to one necessary Cause
It has been now a considerable Time since sufficiently made out that our Atmosphere is a thin elastic Fluid one Part of which gravitates upon another and whose Pressure is communicated every Way in a Sphere to any given Part thereof From hence it follows That if by any external Cause the Gravity of any one Part shoud be taken off or diminished that from all sides around this Part the more heavy Air would rush in to restore the Equilibrium which must of necessity be preserved in all Fluids Now this violent running in of the heavier Air would certainly produce a Wind which is no more than a strong Motion of the Air in some determined Direction If therefore we can find any outward Cause that would at these stated Seasons we have mentioned diminish the Weight or Pressure of the Atmosphere we shall have the genuine Reason of these periodical Winds and the necessary Consequences thereof
The Flux and Reflux of the Sea was a Phoenomenon too visible and too much conducing to the Subsistance of Mankind and all other Animals to be neglected by those who applied themselves to the Study of Nature however all their Attempts to explain this admirable Contrivance of infinite Wisdom were unsuccessful till Sir
Isaac Newton
reveald to the World juster Principles and by a truer Philosophy than was formerly known shewd us how by the united or divided Forces of the Sun and Moon which are encreased and lessened by several Circumstances all the Varieties of the Tides are to be accounted for And since all the Changes we have enumerated in the Atmosphere do fall out at the same Times when those happen in the Ocean and likewise whereas both the Waters of the Sea and the Air of our Earth are Fluids subject in a great Measure to the same Laws of Motion it is plain that the Rule of our great Philosopher takes place here
viz That natural Effects of the same kind are owing to the same Causes
Newton
Princip p


What Difference that known Property of the Air which is not in Water makes in the Case I shall shew anon setting aside the Consideration of that for the present It is certain That as the Sea is so must our Air twice every  Hours be raised upwards to a considerable Height by the Attraction of the Moon coming to the Meridian so that instead of a
Spherical
it must form itself into a
Spheroidal
or
Oval
Figure whose longest Diameter being produced would pass thro the Moon That the like raising must form itself into a
Spheroidal
or
Oval
Figure whose longest Diameter being produced would pass thro the Moon That the like raising must follow as often as the Sun is in the Meridian of any Place either above or below the Horizon Moreover That this Elevation is
greatest
upon the new and full Moons because both Sun and Moon do then conspire in their Attraction
least
on the Quarters in that they then drawing different Ways tis only the Difference of their Actions produces the Effect Lastly That this Intumescence will be of a
middle Degree
at the Time between the Quarters and new and full Moon
From the same Principles the Motion upwards of the Air will be strongest of all about the Equinoxes the Equinoctial Line being over that Circle of the Globe which has the greatest Diameter either of the Luminaries when in that are nearer and the Agitation of the Fluid Spheroid revolving about a greater Circle is greater besides the centrifugal Force arising from the diurnal Rotation is there greatest of all This will still be more considerable about the new and full Moons happening at these Times for the Reasons just now mentioned And the least Attraction will be about the Quadratures of these Lunar Months because the Declination of the Moon from the Equator is then greatest The different Distances of the Moon in her Perigaeum and Apogaeum are the Reason that these full Changes fall out a little before the Vernal and after the Autumnal Equinox Now the Inverse of all this happens when the Luminaries are in the Solstitial Circles Lastly In the same Parallel when the Moons Declination is towards the elevated Pole the Attraction is strongest when the Moon is in that Places Meridian and weakest when she is in the opposite Places Meridian The contrary happens in the opposite Parallel by reason of the spheroidal Figure of the Earth and its Atmosphere
Whatever has been said on this Head is no more than applying what Sir
Isaac Newton
has demonstrated of the Sea to our Atmosphere and it is needless to shew how necessarily those Appearances just now mentioned of
Winds
at the stated Times
&c
must happen hereupon It will be of more use to consider the Proportion of the Forces of the two Luminaries upon the
Air
to that which they have upon the Water of our Globe that it may the more plainly appear what Influence the Alterations hereby made must have upon the Animal Body
Sir
Isaac Newton
has demonstrated
Princip Lib

Prop

That the Force of the Sun to move the Sea is to the Force of Gravity as  to  Let that be
And that the Force of the Moon to raise the Sea is to Gravity as  to  Let this be
And since the centrifugal Force of the Parts of the Earth arising from its diurnal Motion is to Gravity as  to  Let this be
The same Philosopher has taught us
Ibid Lib

Prop

that the centrifugal Force raises the Water at the Equator above the Water at the Poles to the Height of  Feet Wherefore if that Force which is as  raises the Ocean to  Feet the united Forces of the Sun and Moon which are as  will raise the same to  Feet for 
divisor
  
Proxime
Now we know that the more easily the Water can obey the Attraction with the more Force are the Tides moved but since as Mr
Halley
has determind it
Philos Trans
No 
our Atmosphere is extended to  Miles whereas the middle Depth of the Ocean is but about half a Mile it is plain that the Air revolving in a Sphere about  Times larger than that of the Ocean will have a proportionably greater Agitation
Besides Rocks Shelves and the Inequality of Shoars are a great Stop to the Access and Recess of the Sea But nothing repels the rising Air whic his also of such Thinness and Fluidity that it is easily driven and runs every Way
Nor ought we to omit that it is the universal Law of Bodies attracted that the Force of Attraction is reciprocally as the Squares of their Distances so that the Action of the Sun and Moon will be greater upon the Air than upon the Water upon the Account of its Nearness
But the Consideration of the Elasticity is still of greater Moment here of which this is the Nature that it is reciprocally as the Pressure so that the incumbent Weight being diminished by the Attraction the Air underneath will upon this Score be mightily expanded
These and such like Causes will make the Tides in the Air to be much greater than those of the Ocean nor is it necessary to our purpose to determine by nice Calculations their particular Forces it is sufficient to have proved that these Motions must both be universal and also return at certain Intervals
Now since the raising of the Water of the Ocean  Feet produces Torrents of such a prodigious Force we may easily conceive what Tempests of Winds if not otherwise checkd the Elevation of the Air much higher perhaps above a Mile will necessarily cause And there is no doubt to be made but that the same infinitely wise Being who contrived the Flux and Reflux of the Sea to secure that vast Collection of Waters from Stagnation and Corruption which would inevitably destroy all the Animals and Vegetables on this Globe has ordered this Ebb and Flood of the Air of our Atmosphere with the like good Design that is to preserve in Case all other Causes should fail as they may and at Times do in some Countries the sweet Freshness and brisk Temper of this Fluid so necessary to Life and keep it by a kind of continual Circulation from Deadness and Stinking
This Reasoning is liable to only one Objection that I know of and that is this That the Appearances we have mentioned cannot be owing to the Causes now assigned since by Calculation from them the Mercury must at new and full Moon subside in the Barometer to a certain Degree which yet we do not observe to happen
In answer to which besides that there have been some Observations made of the sinking of the Mercury at those Times and it may perhaps be the Fault of the Observers that these have not been reduced to any Rule we are to consider That altho Winds and Alterations in the Pressure of the Atmosphere are the necessary Consequents of the lunar Attraction and true Causes of the different Rise of the Mercury in the Barometer yet these may be produced many other ways too and therefore tho regularly the Mercury would always fall at the new and full Moon those other Causes may be strong enough even to raise it at those Seasons in as much as two contrary Winds for Instance blowing towards the Place of Observation may accumulate the Air there so as to increase both the Height and Weight of the incumbent Cylinder in like Manner the Direction of two Winds may be such as meeting at a certain Angle they may keep the Gravity of the Air in the middle Place unalterd and a Thousand such Varieties there may be by which the Regularity of Appearances of this Nature may be hinderd Now the other Springs from which such Changes in the Air may arise are these
 Elastic Vapours forcd from the Bowels of the Earth by subterraneous Heats and condensed by whatever Cause in the Atmosphere
 A Mixture of Effluvia of different Qualities in the Air may by Rarefactions Fermentations
&c
produce Winds and other Effects like those resulting from the Combination of some Chymical Liquors and that such Things happen we are assurd from the Nature of Thunder Lightning and Meteors
 From the Eruptions of Vulcanoes and Earthquakes in distant Places Winds may be propagated to remoter Countries
 The divided or united Forces of the other Planets and of Comets may variously disturb the Influence of the Sun and Moon
&c
We know that there happen violent Tempests in the upper Regions of the Air while we below enjoy a Calm and how many Ridges of Mountains there are on our Globe which interrupt and check the Propagation of the Winds so that it is no wonder that the Phaenomena we have ascribed to the Action of the Sun and Moon are not always constant and uniform and that every Effect does not hereupon follow which were there no other Powers in Nature able to alter the Influence of this might in a very regular and uniform Manner be expected from it
These Things being premised it will not be difficult to shew as was proposed in the first Place that these Changes in our Atmosphere at high Water new and full Moon the Equinoxes
&c
must occasion some Alterations in all Animal Bodies and that from the following Considerations
 All living Creatures require Air of a determind Gravity to perform Respiration easily and with Advantage for it is by its Weight that this Fluid insinuates itself into the Cavity of the Breast and Lungs Now the Gravity as we have provd being lessend at these Seasons a smaller Quantity only will insinuate itself and this must be of smaller Force to comminute the Blood and forward its Passage into the left Ventricle of the Heart whence a slower Circulation insues and the Secretion of the Spirits is diminished
 This Effect will be the more sure in that the Elasticity of the Atmosphere is likewise diminishd Animals want Air as heavy so elastic to a certain Degree for as this is by its Weight forced into the Cavity of the
Thorax
in Inspiration so the Muscles of the
Abdomen
press it into the
Bronchi
in Expiration where the bending Force being somewhat taken off and springy Bodies when unbended exerting their Power every Way in Proportion to their Pressures the Parts of the Air push against all the Sides of the
Vesiculae
and promote the Passage of the Blood
We have a convincing Instance of all this in those who go to the Top of high Mountains for the Air is there so pure as they call it that is wants so much of its Gravity and Elasticity that they breathe with very great Difficulty
 All the Fluids in Animals have in them a Mixture of elastic
Aura
which when set at Liberty shews its Energy and causes those Fermentations we observe in the Blood and Spirits Now when the Pressure of the Atmosphere upon the Surface of our Body is diminishd the inward Air in the Vessels must necessarily be inabled to exert its Force in Proportion to the lessening the Gravity and Elasticity of the outward hereupon the Juices begin to ferment change the Union and Cohaesion of their Parts break their Canals
&c
This is very plain in living Creatures put into the Receiver exhausted by the Air-Pump which always swell as the Air is more and more drawn out their Lungs at the same Time contracting themselves and falling so together as to be hardly discernible

Ere we proceed to Matters of Fact it may be worth the while to take Notice that Effects depending on such Causes as these must of Necessity be most visible in weak Bodies and morbid Constitutions when other Circumstances concur to their taking Place For this Reason whatever Mischiefs do hence follow cannot in the least disparage the wise Contrivance of infinite Power in ordering these Tides of our Atmosphere The Author of Nature we know has made
Things to the greatest Advantage that could be for the whole System of Animals on our Globe but it was impossible that such a Disposition should not in some Cases be prejudicial to a few The Position and Distance of the Sun are so adjusted as to give in the most beneficial Manner possible Heat and Light to the Earth yet this notwithstanding some Places may be too hot for some weakly Bodies some Autumns too sultry to agree with some Animals and some Winters too cold to be endured by some tender Creatures The whole however we must own is most carefully provided for Besides as most of these last mentioned Inconveniences are by easy Shifts to be avoided so there are such powerful Checks put to this aerial Flux and Reflux so many ways of abating the Damages accruing from it now and then that these are of no Account in comparison of the mighty Benefits hence arising in which the Race of Mankind does universally share
A DISCOURSE Concerning the ACTION of the SUN and MOON on
Animal Bodies
PART II
THERE are no Histories in Physick which we may more safely take upon the Credit of the Authors who relate em than such as we are now going to mention In some Cases a Point may perhaps be strained to serve a darling Hypothesis which the Writer has taken up but here we are much more likely to have pure Matter of Fact because hitherto no one has pretended the Appearances of this Kind to be within the Reach of any Scheme of Philosophy
Epileptical Diseases besides the other Difficulties with which they are attended have this also surprizing that in some the Fits do constantly return every New and Full Moon

tells a Story of one Epileptick who had apparent Spots in her Face which according to the Time of the Moon varied both their Colour and Magnitude
But no greater Consent in such Cases was perhaps ever observed than what I saw some Time since in a Child about five Years old in which the Convulsions were so strong and frequent that Life was almost despaird of and by Evacuations and other Medicines very difficulty saved The Girl who was of a lusty full Habit of Body continued well for a few Days but was at Full Moon again seized with a most violent Fit after which the Disease kept its Periods constant and regular with the Tides She lay always Speechless during the whole Time of Flood and recovered upon the Ebb The Father who lives by the
Thames
Side and does Business upon the River observed these Returns to be so punctual that not only coming Home he knew how the Child was before he saw it but in the Night has risen to his Employ being warned by Cries when coming out of her Fit of the turning of the Water This continued  Days that is to the next great Change of the Moon and then a dry Scab on the Crown of the Head the Effect of an Epispastick Plaister with which I had covered the whole
Occiput
in the Beginning of the Illness broke and from the Sore tho there had been no sensible Discharge this Way for above a Fortnight ran a considerable Quantity of limpid Serum upon which the Fits returning no more I took great Care to promote this new Evacuation by proper Applications with desired Success for some Time and when it ceased besides two or three Purges with
Mercurius Dulcis
&c ordered an Issue in the Neck which being thought troublesome was made in the Arm the Patient however has never since felt any Attacks of those frightful Symptoms
Whether or no it be thro Want of due Heed and Enquiry that we have not in all the Collections of Histories and Cases any Instance of the like Nature so particular as this is I know not this is certain that as the
Vertigo
is a Disease nearly related to the
Epilepsy
and the
Hysterical Symptoms
do partake of the same Nature so both one and the other are frequently observed to obey the Lunar Influence In like Manner the raving Fits of mad People which keep Lunar Periods are generally in some Degree Epileptic too

afford us remarkable Instances of Periodical
Palseys
Every one knows how great a Share the Moon has in forwarding those Evacuations of the weaker Sex which have their Name from the constant Regularity they keep in their Returns and there is no Question to be made but the Correspondency we here observe would be greater still and even Universal did not many Accidents and the infinite Varieties in particular Constitutions one Way or other concur to make a Difference It is very observable that in Countries nearest to the
Aequator
where we have proved the Lunar Action to be strongest these Monthly Secretions are in much greater Quantity than in those near the Poles where this Force is weakest This
Hippocrates
De Aere Aquis & Locis
takes Notice of and gives it as one Reason why the Women in
Scythia
are not very fruitful
The Case being thus with Females it is no wonder if we sometimes meet with Periodical Haemorrhages answering to the Times of the Moon in Males also For as a greater Quantity of Blood in Proportion to the Bulk in
one
Sex is the Reason of its discharging itself thro proper Ducts at certain Intervals when the Pressure of the external Air being diminishd the internal
Aura
can exert its Elasticity so in the
other
if at any Time there happens to be a Superabundancy of the same Fluid together with a weak Tone of the Fibres it is plain that the Vessels will be most easily burst when the Resistance of the Atmosphere is least And this more especially if any accidental Hurt or rarefying Force has first given Occasion to the other Causes to take Effect
I know a Gentleman of a tender Frame of Body who having once by over-reaching strained the Parts about the Breast fell thereupon into a Spitting of Blood which for a Year and half constantly returnd every New Moon and decreasing gradually continued always four or five Days The Fits being more or less considerable according as his Management about that Time contributed to a greater or lesser Fullness of the Vessels
We have two notable Instances of the like Nature in our Philosophical Transactions the one
No 
of a Person who from his Infancy to the th Year of his Age had every full Moon an Eruption of Blood on the right Side of the Nail of his left Thumb at first to three or four Ounces and after his sixteenth Year to half a Pound each Time which when by searing the Part with a hot Iron it stopped he fell into a
Sputum Sanguinis
and by frequent Bleeding
&c
was very difficultly saved from a Consumption The other
Philes Trans
No 
is a Story of an
Inn-Keeper
in
Ireland
who from the d Year of his Life to the th in which it killed him suffered a Periodical Evacuation at the Point of the Fore-Finger of his Right-hand and altho the Fits here kept not their Returns so certain as in the fore-mentioned Case it may be either from the irregular Way of living of the Patient or the mighty Change every Effusion made in his Habit of Body the Quantity seldom amounting to less than four Pounds at a Time yet there is this remarkable Circumstance in the Relation that the first Beginning of this
Haemorrhage
was at
Easter
that is the next Full Moon after the Vernal
Equinox
which is one of the two Seasons of the Year at which we have proved the Attraction of the Air or lessening of its Pressure to be greater than at any other Time whatsoever
But we are besides this to consider That the static Chair and nice Observation taught
Sanctorius
Medicin Static
Sect  Aph 
That
Men do increase a Pound or two in their Weight every Month which Overplus is discharged at the Months End by a Crisis of copious or thick turbid Urine
It is not therefore at all strange that we shoud once a Month be liable to the Returns of such Distempers as depend upon a Fullness of the Vessels that these should take Place at those Times especially when the ambient Air is least able to repress the Turgency and that tho New and Full Moon are both of equal Force yet that sometimes one and sometimes the other only should Influence the Periods according as this or that happens to fall in with the inward Repletion
The Afflux of Humours to Ulcers is sometimes manifestly altered by this Power

He knew a young Gentlewoman whose Beauty depended upon the Lunar Force insomuch that at Full Moon she was Plump and very Handsome but in the Decrease of the Planet so wan and ill-favoured that she was ashamd to go abroad till the Return of the New Moon gave
Fullness
to her Face and
Attraction
to her Charms
Tho this is indeed no more than an Influence of the same Kind with that the Moon has always been observed to have upon Shell-Fish and some other living Creatures For as the old
Latin
Poet
Lucilius
says

It is very well worth the Pains to enquire what Share such an Alteration in the Weight and Pressure of the Atmosphere may have in the
Crises
or Changes of acute Diseases The Antients made great Account of
critical
Days and regulated their Practice according to the Expectation they had from them This Part of Physick is grown now into Disuse quite slighted and even ridiculed and that I suppose chiefly for these two Reasons In the first Place because the earliest Observations of this Kind which were drawn into Rules being made in
Eastern
Countries when these came to be applied to the Distempers of the
Northern
Regions without Allowance given for the Difference of the Climate they were oftentimes found not to answer And secondly Fevers of old were treated with few or no Medicines the Motions of Nature were carefully watched and no Violence offerd to interrupt her Work The Histories therefore of
Crises
though of great Use and Certainty under such Management as this were at length unavoidably set aside and lost when acute Cases came to be cured according to this or that Hypothesis not only by Evacuations but hot or cold Alteratives too there being no longer any Room for those Laws of Practice which supposed a regular and uniform Progress of the Distemper
Wherefore in order to understand a little both what might induce the first Masters of our Profession to so nice and strict an Observance in this Point and what Grounds there may be now for a more due Regard to their Precepts even upon the Score of the Lunar Attraction only I propose the following Remarks
 All Epidemick Diseases do in their regular Course require a stated Time in which they come to their Height decline and leave the Body free
This is so constant and certain that when a Fever of any
Constitution
which is
continual
in one Subject happens from some other Cause in another to be
intermitting
the Paroxisms do always return so often as all together to make up just as many Days of Illness as he suffers whose Distemper goes on from Beginning to End without any Abatement
Dr
Sydenham
a sworn Enemy to all Theories learnd thus much from downright Observation and gives this Reason why autumnal Quartans holds six Months because by Computation the Fits of so long a Time amount to  Hours or  Days the Period of a continual Fever of the same Season
De Febr Intermit
Ann  pag
m

So
Galen
takes Notice that when an exquisite Tertain is terminated in seven Paroxisms a true Continual at the same Time has its Crisis in seven Days that is the Fever lasts as long in one as in the other in as much says he as
a Fit in an Intermitting Fever answers to a Day in a Continual
Comment in Aphor
 lib 
& de Crisib
lib  c 
Now this so comes to pass because
 In these Cases there is always a Fermentation in the Blood which goes not off till the active Particles are thrown out by those Organs of Secretion which according to the Laws of Motion are most fitted to separate em And
 As different Liquors put upon a Ferment are depurated in different Times so the Arterial Fluid takes up a determined Period of which it is discharged of an induced Effervescence
 The Symptoms during this Ebullition do not proceed all along in the same Tenour but on some Days particularly they give such evident Marks of their good or bad Quality that the Nature of the ensuing
Solution
may very well be guessd at and foretold by em
Things being thus Those Days on which the Disease was so evidently terminated one Way or other might very justly be calld the Days of
Crisis
and those upon which the Tendency of Illness was discovered by most visible Tokens the
Indices
of the
critical Days
And thus far the Foundation was good but when a false Theory happend unluckily to be joined to true Observations this did a little puzzle the Cause
Hippocrates
it is plain knew not to what to ascribe that remarkable Regularity with which he saw the Periods of Fevers were ended on the
Seventh Fourteenth One and Twentieth
Day
&c Pythagoras
his Philosophy was in those Ages very Famous of which
Harmony
and the
Mysteries of Numbers
made a considerable Part
Odd
were more powerful than
Even
and
Seven
was the most perfect of all Our great Physician espoused these Notions
Epidem
lib  Sect 
and confined the Stages of acute Distempers to a
Septenary
Progression

De Septimestri Parta
 upon which this Inconvenience followd that when a Crisis fell out a Day sooner or later than this Computation required his Measures were quite broken and that this must necessarily oftentimes happen will appear by and by
Upon this Score
Asclepiades
rejected this whole Doctrine as vain
Vid Celsum
lib  c 
and
Celsus
finding it to be too nice and scrupulous observes that the
Pythagorean Numbers led the Ancients into the Error
Ibid
Galen
being aware of this succeeded much better in his reasoning upon the Matter and very happily imputed the critical Changes not to the Power of Numbers but to the Influence of the Moon which he observes
has a mighty Action upon our Earth exceeding the other Planets not in Energy but in Nearness
De Diebus Decretor
lib 
So that according to him the Septenary Periods in Diseases are owing to the
Quarterly Lunar Phases which are the Times of the greatest Force and which return in about seven Days
Ibid
The Result of the whole Affair in short is this A
Crisis
is no more than the Expulsion of the morbific Matter out of the Body thro some or other of the Secretory Organs in order to which it is necessary that this should be prepard and comminuted to such a Degree as is required to make it pass into the Orifices of the respective Glands and therefore
as
the most
perfect Crisis
is by
Sweat
both by Reason that the Subcutaneous Glands do naturally discharge more than all the other put together and also that their Ducts being the smallest of any whatsoever comes this Way is certainly very well divided and broken
so
the most
imperfect
is an
Haemorrhage
because This is an Argument that what offends is not fit to be cast off in any Part and consequently breaks the Vessels by the Effervescence of the Blood An
Abscess
in those Organs which separate thick slimy Juices is of a middle Nature betwixt these two
Now it is very plain That if the Time in which either the Peccant Humour is prepard for Secretion or the Fermentation of the Blood is come to its Height falls in with those Changes in the Atmosphere which diminish its Pressure the
Crisis
will then be more compleat and large And also that this Work may be forwarded or delayd a Day upon the Account of such an Alteration in the Air the Distention of the Vessels upon which it depends being hereby made more easy and a weak Habit of Body in some Cases standing in need of this outward Assistance Thus a Fever which requires about a Week to its Period may sometimes as
Hippocrates
observed have a good Crisis on the sixth and sometimes not till the eighth Day
In Order therefore to make true Observations of this Kind the Time of Invasion is to be considered The genuine Course of the Distemper must first be watched which is not to be interrupted by any violent Methods The Strength of Nature in the Patient is to be considered and by what Secretions the Crisis is most likely to be performed and it will then be found that not only the
New
and
Full
Moons but even the
Southings
whether visible or latent of the Planet are here of considerable Moment
For Confirmation of which we need only to reflect on what Mr
Paschal
has remarkd
concerning the Motions of Diseases and Births and Deaths
Philos Transact
No 
 Dividing the
into Four Senaries of Hours the first consists of three Hours before the Southing of the Moon and three after the second of the six Hours following and the third and fourth of the remaining Quarters of the natural Day He takes Notice that none are born or die a natural Death in the first and third Senaries which he calls first and second Tides but all either in the second or fourth Senaries which he calls first and second Ebbs In like manner that in Agues the Tumult of the Fits generally lasts all the Tiding-Time and then goes off in kindly Sweats in the Ebbs From whence he very rationally concludes that Motion Vigour Action Strength
&c
appear most and do best in the
Tiding Senaries
and that Rest Relaxation Decay Dissolution
&c
belong to the
Ebbing Senaries
A
COROLLARY
IT having been explained in the Beginning of this Discourse how those Influences of the Heavens which favour the
Returns of Diseases
may likewise raise
Winds
at the same Times and that we feel the different Effects of
These
according as other Causes do concur to the Motion of the Air it will not be amiss to shew in one Instance or two how much Natural History confirms this Reasoning
There happened on the th of
November
 a little before Midnight a most terrible
Storm
of
Wind
the Fury of it is still fresh in every ones Mind which lasted above six Hours
It is not to the present Purpose to relate its History and Causes What we observe is That the Moon was at that Time
in Perigaeo
and just upon the Change to
New
Upon both which Accounts its Action in raising the Atmosphere must be great And hence indeed the
Tides
which followed were also very great and the
Mercury
in the
Barometer
at least in most Places fell very low
This Influence was without all doubt assisted by some such other Causes of
Winds
as we have mentioned these we cant know but may however take Notice how much the manifest State of the Air contributed to this Calamity
After a greater Quantity of Rains than ordinary had fallen in the Summer and Autumn in those Places where the Storm was felt the Winter came on much warmer than usual so that the Liquor in a Thermometer of which the th Degree notes Frost never fell below the th
Vid
Philos Transact No 

Hence we may very well believe that the Atmosphere was at that Time filld with Atoms of
Salts
and
Sulphur
out of the Vapours raisd by the Heat from the moist Earth which being variously combined and agitated gave that deadly Force to the Motion of the Air
A Proof of this we have not only from the frequent
Flashes
of
Lightning
observed a little before the Storm but also from what the Country People took Notice of the next Day
viz
that the Grass and Twiggs of the Trees in Fields remote from the Sea tasted very salt so that the Cattle woud not feed on them
Our Histories mention another Storm which if not equal to this last in Violence is however thought the greatest that had then ever been known and memorable from the Time at which it happened
viz
on the d of
September
 the Day on which the Usurper
Oliver Cromwell
died
No
Ephemerides
that I know of relate the Condition of the Air that Year but it is sufficient to remark That whatever other Causes concurrd their Force was accompanied with a
Full Moon
just before the Time of the
Autumnal Equinox
Upon the same Score it comes to pass That in those Countries which are subject to frequent
Inundations
these Calamities are observed to happen at the Time of the
Moon
s greatest Influence so that the learned
Baccius
Del
Tevere lib  p 
has rightly enough laid the Cause of such Mischiefs upon immoderate
Tides of the Ocean
being unhappily accompanied with the
attractive Force
of some or other
Stars
Dr
Childrey
in his
Britannia Baconica
Pag 
 has from several Instances shewn the
Lunar
Action in Damages of this Kind
Such and the like
Natural
Causes have
Storms
and
Tempests
for as to the Question of Divine Power whether or no Calamities of this Kind do not sometimes by the Anger of Heaven happen out of the Course of Nature it is not my Business to dispute nor would I by any means endeavour to absolve Mens Minds from the Bands of Religion For although we must allow all the Parts of the Machine of this World to be framed and moved by established Laws and that the same Disposition of its Fabrick which is most beneficial to the whole must of Necessity in some few Places now and then occasion Hurts and Mischiefs it is however most highly reasonable that we should yield to the Supreme Creator an absolute Power over all his Works Concluding withal that it was perhaps agreeable to Divine Wisdom to order the Make of the World after such a Manner as might sometimes bring Mischiefs and Calamities upon Mankind whom it was necessary by the Frights of
Storms Thunder
and
Lightning
to keep in a continual Sense of their Duty

PART ONEThe Old Buccaneer
The Old Sea-dog at the Admiral Benbow
SQUIRE TRELAWNEY Dr Livesey and the rest of these gentlemen having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island from the beginning to the end keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island and that only because there is still treasure not yet lifted I take up my pen in the year of grace __ and go back to the time when my father kept the Admiral Benbow inn and the brown old seaman with the sabre cut first took up his lodging under our roof
I remember him as if it were yesterday as he came plodding to the inn door his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrowa tall strong heavy nut-brown man his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat his hands ragged and scarred with black broken nails and the sabre cut across one cheek a dirty livid white I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards
Fifteen men on the dead mans chest--
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
in the high old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried and when my father appeared called roughly for a glass of rum This when it was brought to him he drank slowly like a connoisseur lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard
This is a handy cove says he at length and a pleasant sittyated grog-shop Much company mate
My father told him no very little company the more was the pity
Well then said he this is the berth for me Here you matey he cried to the man who trundled the barrow bring up alongside and help up my chest Ill stay here a bit he continued Im a plain man rum and bacon and eggs is what I want and that head up there for to watch ships off What you mought call me You mought call me captain Oh I see what youre atthere and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold You can tell me when Ive worked through that says he looking as fierce as a commander
And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast and hearing ours well spoken of I suppose and described as lonely had chosen it from the others for his place of residence And that was all we could learn of our guest
He was a very silent man by custom All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong Mostly he would not speak when spoken to only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow as now and then some did making by the coast road for Bristol he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present For me at least there was no secret about the matter for I was in a way a sharer in his alarms He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my weather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg and let him know the moment he appeared Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it bring me my four-penny piece and repeat his orders to look out for the seafaring man with one leg
How that personage haunted my dreams I need scarcely tell you On stormy nights when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs I would see him in a thousand forms and with a thousand diabolical expressions Now the leg would be cut off at the knee now at the hip now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg and that in the middle of his body To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece in the shape of these abominable fancies
But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked old wild sea-songs minding nobody but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing Often I have heard the house shaking with Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum all the neighbours joining in for dear life with the fear of death upon them and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question or sometimes because none was put and so he judged the company was not following his story Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed
His stories were what frightened people worst of all Dreadful stories they wereabout hanging and walking the plank and storms at sea and the Dry Tortugas and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described My father was always saying the inn would be ruined for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down and sent shivering to their beds but I really believe his presence did us good People were frightened at the time but on looking back they rather liked it it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him calling him a true sea-dog and a real old salt and such like names and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea
In one way indeed he bade fair to ruin us for he kept on staying week after week and at last month after month so that all the money had been long exhausted and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more If ever he mentioned it the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared and stared my poor father out of the room I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death
All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down he let it hang from that day forth though it was a great annoyance when it blew I remember the appearance of his coat which he patched himself upstairs in his room and which before the end was nothing but patches He never wrote or received a letter and he never spoke with any but the neighbours and with these for the most part only when drunk on rum The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open
He was only once crossed and that was towards the end when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off Dr Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient took a bit of dinner from my mother and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet for we had no stabling at the old Benbow I followed him in and I remember observing the contrast the neat bright doctor with his powder as white as snow and his bright black eyes and pleasant manners made with the coltish country folk and above all with that filthy heavy bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours sitting far gone in rum with his arms on the table Suddenly hethe captain that isbegan to pipe up his eternal song
Fifteen men on the dead mans chest--
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
Drink and the devil had done for the rest--
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
At first I had supposed the dead mans chest to be that identical big box of his upstairs in the front room and the thought had been mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song it was new that night to nobody but Dr Livesey and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor the gardener on a new cure for the rheumatics In the meantime the captain gradually brightened up at his own music and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence The voices stopped at once all but Dr Liveseys he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two The captain glared at him for a while flapped his hand again glared still harder and at last broke out with a villainous low oath Silence there between decks
Were you addressing me sir says the doctor and when the ruffian had told him with another oath that this was so I have only one thing to say to you sir replies the doctor that if you keep on drinking rum the world will soon be quit of a very dirty scoundrel
The old fellows fury was awful He sprang to his feet drew and opened a sailors clasp-knife and balancing it open on the palm of his hand threatened to pin the doctor to the wall
The doctor never so much as moved He spoke to him as before over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice rather high so that all the room might hear but perfectly calm and steady If you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket I promise upon my honour you shall hang at the next assizes
Then followed a battle of looks between them but the captain soon knuckled under put up his weapon and resumed his seat grumbling like a beaten dog
And now sir continued the doctor since I now know theres such a fellow in my district you may count Ill have an eye upon you day and night Im not a doctor only Im a magistrate and if I catch a breath of complaint against you if its only for a piece of incivility like tonights Ill take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this Let that suffice
Soon after Dr Liveseys horse came to the door and he rode away but the captain held his peace that evening and for many evenings to come
Black Dog Appears and Disappears
IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain though not as you will see of his affairs It was a bitter cold winter with long hard frosts and heavy gales and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring He sank daily and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest
It was one January morning very earlya pinching frosty morningthe cove all grey with hoar-frost the ripple lapping softly on the stones the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat his brass telescope under his arm his hat tilted back upon his head I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation as though his mind was still running upon Dr Livesey
Well mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captains return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before He was a pale tallowy creature wanting two fingers of the left hand and though he wore a cutlass he did not look much like a fighter I had always my eye open for seafaring men with one leg or two and I remember this one puzzled me He was not sailorly and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too
I asked him what was for his service and he said he would take rum but as I was going out of the room to fetch it he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near I paused where I was with my napkin in my hand
Come here sonny says he Come nearer here
I took a step nearer
Is this here table for my mate Bill he asked with a kind of leer
I told him I did not know his mate Bill and this was for a person who stayed in our house whom we called the captain
Well said he my mate Bill would be called the captain as like as not He has a cut on one cheek and a mighty pleasant way with him particularly in drink has my mate Bill Well put it for argument like that your captain has a cut on one cheekand well put it if you like that that cheeks the right one Ah well I told you Now is my mate Bill in this here house
I told him he was out walking
Which way sonny Which way is he gone
And when I had pointed out the rock and told him how the captain was likely to return and how soon and answered a few other questions Ah said he thisll be as good as drink to my mate Bill
The expression of his face as he said these words was not at all pleasant and I had my own reasons for thinking that the stranger was mistaken even supposing he meant what he said But it was no affair of mine I thought and besides it was difficult to know what to do The stranger kept hanging about just inside the inn door peering round the corner like a cat waiting for a mouse Once I stepped out myself into the road but he immediately called me back and as I did not obey quick enough for his fancy a most horrible change came over his tallowy face and he ordered me in with an oath that made me jump As soon as I was back again he returned to his former manner half fawning half sneering patted me on the shoulder told me I was a good boy and he had taken quite a fancy to me I have a son of my own said he as like you as two blocks and hes all the pride of my art But the great thing for boys is discipline sonnydiscipline Now if you had sailed along of Bill you wouldnt have stood there to be spoke to twicenot you That was never Bills way nor the way of sich as sailed with him And here sure enough is my mate Bill with a spy-glass under his arm bless his old art to be sure You and mell just go back into the parlour sonny and get behind the door and well give Bill a little surprisebless his art I say again
So saying the stranger backed along with me into the parlour and put me behind him in the corner so that we were both hidden by the open door I was very uneasy and alarmed as you may fancy and it rather added to my fears to observe that the stranger was certainly frightened himself He cleared the hilt of his cutlass and loosened the blade in the sheath and all the time we were waiting there he kept swallowing as if he felt what we used to call a lump in the throat
At last in strode the captain slammed the door behind him without looking to the right or left and marched straight across the room to where his breakfast awaited him
Bill said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big
The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us all the brown had gone out of his face and even his nose was blue he had the look of a man who sees a ghost or the evil one or something worse if anything can be and upon my word I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick
Come Bill you know me you know an old shipmate Bill surely said the stranger
The captain made a sort of gasp
Black Dog said he
And who else returned the other getting more at his ease Black Dog as ever was come for to see his old shipmate Billy at the Admiral Benbow inn Ah Bill Bill we have seen a sight of times us two since I lost them two talons holding up his mutilated hand
Now look here said the captain youve run me down here I am well then speak up what is it
Thats you Bill returned Black Dog youre in the right of it Billy Ill have a glass of rum from this dear child here as Ive took such a liking to and well sit down if you please and talk square like old shipmates
When I returned with the rum they were already seated on either side of the captains breakfast-tableBlack Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one as I thought on his retreat
He bade me go and leave the door wide open None of your keyholes for me sonny he said and I left them together and retired into the bar
For a long time though I certainly did my best to listen I could hear nothing but a low gattling but at last the voices began to grow higher and I could pick up a word or two mostly oaths from the captain
No no no no and an end of it he cried once And again If it comes to swinging swing all say I
Then all of a sudden there was a tremendous explosion of oaths and other noisesthe chair and table went over in a lump a clash of steel followed and then a cry of pain and the next instant I saw Black Dog in full flight and the captain hotly pursuing both with drawn cutlasses and the former streaming blood from the left shoulder Just at the door the captain aimed at the fugitive one last tremendous cut which would certainly have split him to the chine had it not been intercepted by our big signboard of Admiral Benbow You may see the notch on the lower side of the frame to this day
That blow was the last of the battle Once out upon the road Black Dog in spite of his wound showed a wonderful clean pair of heels and disappeared over the edge of the hill in half a minute The captain for his part stood staring at the signboard like a bewildered man Then he passed his hand over his eyes several times and at last turned back into the house
Jim says he rum and as he spoke he reeled a little and caught himself with one hand against the wall
Are you hurt cried I
Rum he repeated I must get away from here Rum Rum
I ran to fetch it but I was quite unsteadied by all that had fallen out and I broke one glass and fouled the tap and while I was still getting in my own way I heard a loud fall in the parlour and running in beheld the captain lying full length upon the floor At the same instant my mother alarmed by the cries and fighting came running downstairs to help me Between us we raised his head He was breathing very loud and hard but his eyes were closed and his face a horrible colour
Dear deary me cried my mother what a disgrace upon the house And your poor father sick
In the meantime we had no idea what to do to help the captain nor any other thought but that he had got his death-hurt in the scuffle with the stranger I got the rum to be sure and tried to put it down his throat but his teeth were tightly shut and his jaws as strong as iron It was a happy relief for us when the door opened and Doctor Livesey came in on his visit to my father
Oh doctor we cried what shall we do Where is he wounded
Wounded A fiddle-sticks end said the doctor No more wounded than you or I The man has had a stroke as I warned him Now Mrs Hawkins just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him if possible nothing about it For my part I must do my best to save this fellows trebly worthless life Jim you get me a basin
When I got back with the basin the doctor had already ripped up the captains sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm It was tattooed in several places Heres luck A fair wind and Billy Bones his fancy were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from itdone as I thought with great spirit
Prophetic said the doctor touching this picture with his finger And now Master Billy Bones if that be your name well have a look at the colour of your blood Jim he said are you afraid of blood
No sir said I
Well then said he you hold the basin and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein
A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown then his glance fell upon me and he looked relieved But suddenly his colour changed and he tried to raise himself crying Wheres Black Dog
There is no Black Dog here said the doctor except what you have on your own back You have been drinking rum you have had a stroke precisely as I told you and I have just very much against my own will dragged you headforemost out of the grave Now Mr Bones
Thats not my name he interrupted
Much I care returned the doctor Its the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance and I call you by it for the sake of shortness and what I have to say to you is this one glass of rum wont kill you but if you take one youll take another and another and I stake my wig if you dont break off short youll diedo you understand thatdie and go to your own place like the man in the Bible Come now make an effort Ill help you to your bed for once
Between us with much trouble we managed to hoist him upstairs and laid him on his bed where his head fell back on the pillow as if he were almost fainting
Now mind you said the doctor I clear my consciencethe name of rum for you is death
And with that he went off to see my father taking me with him by the arm
This is nothing he said as soon as he had closed the door I have drawn blood enough to keep him quiet awhile he should lie for a week where he isthat is the best thing for him and you but another stroke would settle him
The Black Spot
ABOUT noon I stopped at the captains door with some cooling drinks and medicines He was lying very much as we had left him only a little higher and he seemed both weak and excited
Jim he said youre the only one here thats worth anything and you know Ive been always good to you Never a month but Ive given you a silver fourpenny for yourself And now you see mate Im pretty low and deserted by all and Jim youll bring me one noggin of rum now wont you matey
The doctor I began
But he broke in cursing the doctor in a feeble voice but heartily Doctors is all swabs he said and that doctor there why what do he know about seafaring men I been in places hot as pitch and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakeswhat to the doctor know of lands like thatand I lived on rum I tell you Its been meat and drink and man and wife to me and if Im not to have my rum now Im a poor old hulk on a lee shore my bloodll be on you Jim and that doctor swab and he ran on again for a while with curses Look Jim how my fingers fidges he continued in the pleading tone I cant keep em still not I I havent had a drop this blessed day That doctors a fool I tell you If I dont have a drain o rum Jim Ill have the horrors I seen some on em already I seen old Flint in the corner there behind you as plain as print I seen him and if I get the horrors Im a man that has lived rough and Ill raise Cain Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldnt hurt me Ill give you a golden guinea for a noggin Jim
He was growing more and more excited and this alarmed me for my father who was very low that day and needed quiet besides I was reassured by the doctors words now quoted to me and rather offended by the offer of a bribe
I want none of your money said I but what you owe my father Ill get you one glass and no more
When I brought it to him he seized it greedily and drank it out
Aye aye said he thats some better sure enough And now matey did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth
A week at least said I
Thunder he cried A week I cant do that theyd have the black spot on me by then The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment lubbers as couldnt keep what they got and want to nail what is anothers Is that seamanly behaviour now I want to know But Im a saving soul I never wasted good money of mine nor lost it neither and Ill trick em again Im not afraid on em Ill shake out another reef matey and daddle em again
As he was thus speaking he had risen from bed with great difficulty holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out and moving his legs like so much dead weight His words spirited as they were in meaning contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge
That doctors done me he murmured My ears is singing Lay me back
Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place where he lay for a while silent
Jim he said at length you saw that seafaring man today
Black Dog I asked
Ah Black Dog says he HES a bad un but theres worse that put him on Now if I cant get away nohow and they tip me the black spot mind you its my old sea-chest theyre after you get on a horseyou can cant you Well then you get on a horse and go towell yes I willto that eternal doctor swab and tell him to pipe all handsmagistrates and sichand hell lay em aboard at the Admiral Benbowall old Flints crew man and boy all on em thats left I was first mate I was old Flints first mate and Im the ony one as knows the place He gave it me at Savannah when he lay a-dying like as if I was to now you see But you wont peach unless they get the black spot on me or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg Jimhim above all
But what is the black spot captain I asked
Thats a summons mate Ill tell you if they get that But you keep your weather-eye open Jim and Ill share with you equals upon my honour
He wandered a little longer his voice growing weaker but soon after I had given him his medicine which he took like a child with the remark If ever a seaman wanted drugs its me he fell at last into a heavy swoon-like sleep in which I left him What I should have done had all gone well I do not know Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me But as things fell out my poor father died quite suddenly that evening which put all other matters on one side Our natural distress the visits of the neighbours the arranging of the funeral and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain far less to be afraid of him
He got downstairs next morning to be sure and had his meals as usual though he ate little and had more I am afraid than his usual supply of rum for he helped himself out of the bar scowling and blowing through his nose and no one dared to cross him On the night before the funeral he was as drunk as ever and it was shocking in that house of mourning to hear him singing away at his ugly old sea-song but weak as he was we were all in the fear of death for him and the doctor was suddenly taken up with a case many miles away and was never near the house after my fathers death I have said the captain was weak and indeed he seemed rather to grow weaker than regain his strength He clambered up and down stairs and went from the parlour to the bar and back again and sometimes put his nose out of doors to smell the sea holding on to the walls as he went for support and breathing hard and fast like a man on a steep mountain He never particularly addressed me and it is my belief he had as good as forgotten his confidences but his temper was more flighty and allowing for his bodily weakness more violent than ever He had an alarming way now when he was drunk of drawing his cutlass and laying it bare before him on the table But with all that he minded people less and seemed shut up in his own thoughts and rather wandering Once for instance to our extreme wonder he piped up to a different air a kind of country love-song that he must have learned in his youth before he had begun to follow the sea
So things passed until the day after the funeral and about three oclock of a bitter foggy frosty afternoon I was standing at the door for a moment full of sad thoughts about my father when I saw someone drawing slowly near along the road He was plainly blind for he tapped before him with a stick and wore a great green shade over his eyes and nose and he was hunched as if with age or weakness and wore a huge old tattered sea-cloak with a hood that made him appear positively deformed I never saw in my life a more dreadful-looking figure He stopped a little from the inn and raising his voice in an odd sing-song addressed the air in front of him Will any kind friend inform a poor blind man who has lost the precious sight of his eyes in the gracious defence of his native country Englandand God bless King Georgewhere or in what part of this country he may now be
You are at the Admiral Benbow Black Hill Cove my good man said I
I hear a voice said he a young voice Will you give me your hand my kind young friend and lead me in
I held out my hand and the horrible soft-spoken eyeless creature gripped it in a moment like a vise I was so much startled that I struggled to withdraw but the blind man pulled me close up to him with a single action of his arm
Now boy he said take me in to the captain
Sir said I upon my word I dare not
Oh he sneered thats it Take me in straight or Ill break your arm
And he gave it as he spoke a wrench that made me cry out
Sir said I it is for yourself I mean The captain is not what he used to be He sits with a drawn cutlass Another gentleman
Come now march interrupted he and I never heard a voice so cruel and cold and ugly as that blind mans It cowed me more than the pain and I began to obey him at once walking straight in at the door and towards the parlour where our sick old buccaneer was sitting dazed with rum The blind man clung close to me holding me in one iron fist and leaning almost more of his weight on me than I could carry Lead me straight up to him and when Im in view cry out Heres a friend for you Bill If you dont Ill do this and with that he gave me a twitch that I thought would have made me faint Between this and that I was so utterly terrified of the blind beggar that I forgot my terror of the captain and as I opened the parlour door cried out the words he had ordered in a trembling voice
The poor captain raised his eyes and at one look the rum went out of him and left him staring sober The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness He made a movement to rise but I do not believe he had enough force left in his body
Now Bill sit where you are said the beggar If I cant see I can hear a finger stirring Business is business Hold out your left hand Boy take his left hand by the wrist and bring it near to my right
We both obeyed him to the letter and I saw him pass something from the hollow of the hand that held his stick into the palm of the captains which closed upon it instantly
And now thats done said the blind man and at the words he suddenly left hold of me and with incredible accuracy and nimbleness skipped out of the parlour and into the road where as I still stood motionless I could hear his stick go tap-tap-tapping into the distance
It was some time before either I or the captain seemed to gather our senses but at length and about at the same moment I released his wrist which I was still holding and he drew in his hand and looked sharply into the palm
Ten oclock he cried Six hours Well do them yet and he sprang to his feet
Even as he did so he reeled put his hand to his throat stood swaying for a moment and then with a peculiar sound fell from his whole height face foremost to the floor
I ran to him at once calling to my mother But haste was all in vain The captain had been struck dead by thundering apoplexy It is a curious thing to understand for I had certainly never liked the man though of late I had begun to pity him but as soon as I saw that he was dead I burst into a flood of tears It was the second death I had known and the sorrow of the first was still fresh in my heart
The Sea-chest
I LOST no time of course in telling my mother all that I knew and perhaps should have told her long before and we saw ourselves at once in a difficult and dangerous position Some of the mans moneyif he had anywas certainly due to us but it was not likely that our captains shipmates above all the two specimens seen by me Black Dog and the blind beggar would be inclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead mans debts The captains order to mount at once and ride for Doctor Livesey would have left my mother alone and unprotected which was not to be thought of Indeed it seemed impossible for either of us to remain much longer in the house the fall of coals in the kitchen grate the very ticking of the clock filled us with alarms The neighbourhood to our ears seemed haunted by approaching footsteps and what between the dead body of the captain on the parlour floor and the thought of that detestable blind beggar hovering near at hand and ready to return there were moments when as the saying goes I jumped in my skin for terror Something must speedily be resolved upon and it occurred to us at last to go forth together and seek help in the neighbouring hamlet No sooner said than done Bare-headed as we were we ran out at once in the gathering evening and the frosty fog
The hamlet lay not many hundred yards away though out of view on the other side of the next cove and what greatly encouraged me it was in an opposite direction from that whence the blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumably returned We were not many minutes on the road though we sometimes stopped to lay hold of each other and hearken But there was no unusual soundnothing but the low wash of the ripple and the croaking of the inmates of the wood
It was already candle-light when we reached the hamlet and I shall never forget how much I was cheered to see the yellow shine in doors and windows but that as it proved was the best of the help we were likely to get in that quarter Foryou would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselvesno soul would consent to return with us to the Admiral Benbow The more we told of our troubles the moreman woman and childthey clung to the shelter of their houses The name of Captain Flint though it was strange to me was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror Some of the men who had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered besides to have seen several strangers on the road and taking them to be smugglers to have bolted away and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called Kitts Hole For that matter anyone who was a comrade of the captains was enough to frighten them to death And the short and the long of the matter was that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to Dr Liveseys which lay in another direction not one would help us to defend the inn
They say cowardice is infectious but then argument is on the other hand a great emboldener and so when each had said his say my mother made them a speech She would not she declared lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy If none of the rest of you dare she said Jim and I dare Back we will go the way we came and small thanks to you big hulking chicken-hearted men Well have that chest open if we die for it And Ill thank you for that bag Mrs Crossley to bring back our lawful money in
Of course I said I would go with my mother and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness but even then not a man would go along with us All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return while one lad was to ride forward to the doctors in search of armed assistance
My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture A full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog and this increased our haste for it was plain before we came forth again that all would be as bright as day and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers We slipped along the hedges noiseless and swift nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors till to our relief the door of the Admiral Benbow had closed behind us
I slipped the bolt at once and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark alone in the house with the dead captains body Then my mother got a candle in the bar and holding each others hands we advanced into the parlour He lay as we had left him on his back with his eyes open and one arm stretched out
Draw down the blind Jim whispered my mother they might come and watch outside And now said she when I had done so we have to get the key off THAT and whos to touch it I should like to know and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words
I went down on my knees at once On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper blackened on the one side I could not doubt that this was the BLACK SPOT and taking it up I found written on the other side in a very good clear hand this short message You have till ten tonight
He had till ten Mother said I and just as I said it our old clock began striking This sudden noise startled us shockingly but the news was good for it was only six
Now Jim she said that key
I felt in his pockets one after another A few small coins a thimble and some thread and big needles a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end his gully with the crooked handle a pocket compass and a tinder box were all that they contained and I began to despair
Perhaps its round his neck suggested my mother
Overcoming a strong repugnance I tore open his shirt at the neck and there sure enough hanging to a bit of tarry string which I cut with his own gully we found the key At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival
It was like any other seamans chest on the outside the initial B burned on the top of it with a hot iron and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long rough usage
Give me the key said my mother and though the lock was very stiff she had turned it and thrown back the lid in a twinkling
A strong smell of tobacco and tar rose from the interior but nothing was to be seen on the top except a suit of very good clothes carefully brushed and folded They had never been worn my mother said Under that the miscellany begana quadrant a tin canikin several sticks of tobacco two brace of very handsome pistols a piece of bar silver an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make a pair of compasses mounted with brass and five or six curious West Indian shells I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering guilty and hunted life
In the meantime we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets and neither of these were in our way Underneath there was an old boat-cloak whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar My mother pulled it up with impatience and there lay before us the last things in the chest a bundle tied up in oilcloth and looking like papers and a canvas bag that gave forth at a touch the jingle of gold
Ill show these rogues that Im an honest woman said my mother Ill have my dues and not a farthing over Hold Mrs Crossleys bag And she began to count over the amount of the captains score from the sailors bag into the one that I was holding
It was a long difficult business for the coins were of all countries and sizesdoubloons and louis dors and guineas and pieces of eight and I know not what besides all shaken together at random The guineas too were about the scarcest and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count
When we were about half-way through I suddenly put my hand upon her arm for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouththe tap-tapping of the blind mans stick upon the frozen road It drew nearer and nearer while we sat holding our breath Then it struck sharp on the inn door and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter and then there was a long time of silence both within and without At last the tapping recommenced and to our indescribable joy and gratitude died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard
Mother said I take the whole and lets be going for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornets nest about our ears though how thankful I was that I had bolted it none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man
But my mother frightened as she was would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less It was not yet seven she said by a long way she knew her rights and she would have them and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill That was enough and more than enough for both of us
Ill take what I have she said jumping to her feet
And Ill take this to square the count said I picking up the oilskin packet
Next moment we were both groping downstairs leaving the candle by the empty chest and the next we had opened the door and were in full retreat We had not started a moment too soon The fog was rapidly dispersing already the moon shone quite clear on the high ground on either side and it was only in the exact bottom of the dell and round the tavern door that a thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape Far less than half-way to the hamlet very little beyond the bottom of the hill we must come forth into the moonlight Nor was this all for the sound of several footsteps running came already to our ears and as we looked back in their direction a light tossing to and fro and still rapidly advancing showed that one of the newcomers carried a lantern
My dear said my mother suddenly take the money and run on I am going to faint
This was certainly the end for both of us I thought How I cursed the cowardice of the neighbours how I blamed my poor mother for her honesty and her greed for her past foolhardiness and present weakness We were just at the little bridge by good fortune and I helped her tottering as she was to the edge of the bank where sure enough she gave a sigh and fell on my shoulder I do not know how I found the strength to do it at all and I am afraid it was roughly done but I managed to drag her down the bank and a little way under the arch Farther I could not move her for the bridge was too low to let me do more than crawl below it So there we had to staymy mother almost entirely exposed and both of us within earshot of the inn
The Last of the Blind Man
MY curiosity in a sense was stronger than my fear for I could not remain where I was but crept back to the bank again whence sheltering my head behind a bush of broom I might command the road before our door I was scarcely in position ere my enemies began to arrive seven or eight of them running hard their feet beating out of time along the road and the man with the lantern some paces in front Three men ran together hand in hand and I made out even through the mist that the middle man of this trio was the blind beggar The next moment his voice showed me that I was right
Down with the door he cried
Aye aye sir answered two or three and a rush was made upon the Admiral Benbow the lantern-bearer following and then I could see them pause and hear speeches passed in a lower key as if they were surprised to find the door open But the pause was brief for the blind man again issued his commands His voice sounded louder and higher as if he were afire with eagerness and rage
In in in he shouted and cursed them for their delay
Four or five of them obeyed at once two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar There was a pause then a cry of surprise and then a voice shouting from the house Bills dead
But the blind man swore at them again for their delay
Search him some of you shirking lubbers and the rest of you aloft and get the chest he cried
I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs so that the house must have shook with it Promptly afterwards fresh sounds of astonishment arose the window of the captains room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass and a man leaned out into the moonlight head and shoulders and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him
Pew he cried theyve been before us Someones turned the chest out alow and aloft
Is it there roared Pew
The moneys there
The blind man cursed the money
Flints fist I mean he cried
We dont see it here nohow returned the man
Here you below there is it on Bill cried the blind man again
At that another fellow probably him who had remained below to search the captains body came to the door of the inn Bills been overhauled aready said he nothin left
Its these people of the innits that boy I wish I had put his eyes out cried the blind man Pew There were no time agothey had the door bolted when I tried it Scatter lads and find em
Sure enough they left their glim here said the fellow from the window
Scatter and find em Rout the house out reiterated Pew striking with his stick upon the road
Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn heavy feet pounding to and fro furniture thrown over doors kicked in until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again one after another on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captains money was once more clearly audible through the night but this time twice repeated I had thought it to be the blind mans trumpet so to speak summoning his crew to the assault but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet and from its effect upon the buccaneers a signal to warn them of approaching danger
Theres Dirk again said one Twice Well have to budge mates
Budge you skulk cried Pew Dirk was a fool and a coward from the firstyou wouldnt mind him They must be close by they cant be far you have your hands on it Scatter and look for them dogs Oh shiver my soul he cried if I had eyes
This appeal seemed to produce some effect for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber but half-heartedly I thought and with half an eye to their own danger all the time while the rest stood irresolute on the road
You have your hands on thousands you fools and you hang a leg Youd be as rich as kings if you could find it and you know its here and you stand there skulking There wasnt one of you dared face Bill and I did ita blind man And Im to lose my chance for you Im to be a poor crawling beggar sponging for rum when I might be rolling in a coach If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still
Hang it Pew weve got the doubloons grumbled one
They might have hid the blessed thing said another Take the Georges Pew and dont stand here squalling
Squalling was the word for it Pews anger rose so high at these objections till at last his passion completely taking the upper hand he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one
These in their turn cursed back at the blind miscreant threatened him in horrid terms and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp
This quarrel was the saving of us for while it was still raging another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamletthe tramp of horses galloping Almost at the same time a pistol-shot flash and report came from the hedge side And that was plainly the last signal of danger for the buccaneers turned at once and ran separating in every direction one seaward along the cove one slant across the hill and so on so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew Him they had deserted whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not but there he remained behind tapping up and down the road in a frenzy and groping and calling for his comrades Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me towards the hamlet crying Johnny Black Dog Dirk and other names you wont leave old Pew matesnot old Pew
Just then the noise of horses topped the rise and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope
At this Pew saw his error turned with a scream and ran straight for the ditch into which he rolled But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash now utterly bewildered right under the nearest of the coming horses
The rider tried to save him but in vain Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by He fell on his side then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more
I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders They were pulling up at any rate horrified at the accident and I soon saw what they were One tailing out behind the rest was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr Liveseys the rest were revenue officers whom he had met by the way and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once Some news of the lugger in Kitts Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death
Pew was dead stone dead As for my mother when we had carried her up to the hamlet a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again and she was none the worse for her terror though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money In the meantime the supervisor rode on as fast as he could to Kitts Hole but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle leading and sometimes supporting their horses and in continual fear of ambushes so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way though still close in He hailed her A voice replied telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm Soon after the lugger doubled the point and disappeared Mr Dance stood there as he said like a fish out of water and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B to warn the cutter And that said he is just about as good as nothing Theyve got off clean and theres an end Only he added Im glad I trod on Master Pews corns for by this time he had heard my story
I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captains money-bag and a little silver from the till I could see at once that we were ruined Mr Dance could make nothing of the scene
They got the money you say Well then Hawkins what in fortune were they after More money I suppose
No sir not money I think replied I In fact sir I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket and to tell you the truth I should like to get it put in safety
To be sure boy quite right said he Ill take it if you like
I thought perhaps Dr Livesey I began
Perfectly right he interrupted very cheerily perfectly righta gentleman and a magistrate And now I come to think of it I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire Master Pews dead when alls done not that I regret it but hes dead you see and people will make it out against an officer of his Majestys revenue if make it out they can Now Ill tell you Hawkins if you like Ill take you along
I thanked him heartily for the offer and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle
Dogger said Mr Dance you have a good horse take up this lad behind you
As soon as I was mounted holding on to Doggers belt the supervisor gave the word and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr Liveseys house
The Captains Papers
WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr Liveseys door The house was all dark to the front
Mr Dance told me to jump down and knock and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by The door was opened almost at once by the maid
Is Dr Livesey in I asked
No she said he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire
So there we go boys said Mr Dance
This time as the distance was short I did not mount but ran with Doggers stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long leafless moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens Here Mr Dance dismounted and taking me along with him was admitted at a word into the house
The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them where the squire and Dr Livesey sat pipe in hand on either side of a bright fire
I had never seen the squire so near at hand He was a tall man over six feet high and broad in proportion and he had a bluff rough-and-ready face all roughened and reddened and lined in his long travels His eyebrows were very black and moved readily and this gave him a look of some temper not bad you would say but quick and high
Come in Mr Dance says he very stately and condescending
Good evening Dance says the doctor with a nod And good evening to you friend Jim What good wind brings you here
The supervisor stood up straight and stiff and told his story like a lesson and you should have seen how the two gentlemen leaned forward and looked at each other and forgot to smoke in their surprise and interest When they heard how my mother went back to the inn Dr Livesey fairly slapped his thigh and the squire cried Bravo and broke his long pipe against the grate Long before it was done Mr Trelawney that you will remember was the squires name had got up from his seat and was striding about the room and the doctor as if to hear the better had taken off his powdered wig and sat there looking very strange indeed with his own close-cropped black poll
At last Mr Dance finished the story
Mr Dance said the squire you are a very noble fellow And as for riding down that black atrocious miscreant I regard it as an act of virtue sir like stamping on a cockroach This lad Hawkins is a trump I perceive Hawkins will you ring that bell Mr Dance must have some ale
And so Jim said the doctor you have the thing that they were after have you
Here it is sir said I and gave him the oilskin packet
The doctor looked it all over as if his fingers were itching to open it but instead of doing that he put it quietly in the pocket of his coat
Squire said he when Dance has had his ale he must of course be off on his Majestys service but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house and with your permission I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup
As you will Livesey said the squire Hawkins has earned better than cold pie
So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable and I made a hearty supper for I was as hungry as a hawk while Mr Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed
And now squire said the doctor
And now Livesey said the squire in the same breath
One at a time one at a time laughed Dr Livesey You have heard of this Flint I suppose
Heard of him cried the squire Heard of him you say He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed Blackbeard was a child to Flint The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that I tell you sir I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman Ive seen his top-sails with these eyes off Trinidad and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put backput back sir into Port of Spain
Well Ive heard of him myself in England said the doctor But the point is had he money
Money cried the squire Have you heard the story What were these villains after but money What do they care for but money For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money
That we shall soon know replied the doctor But you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in What I want to know is this Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure will that treasure amount to much
Amount sir cried the squire It will amount to this If we have the clue you talk about I fit out a ship in Bristol dock and take you and Hawkins here along and Ill have that treasure if I search a year
Very well said the doctor Now then if Jim is agreeable well open the packet and he laid it before him on the table
The bundle was sewn together and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors It contained two thingsa book and a sealed paper
First of all well try the book observed the doctor
The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it for Dr Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table where I had been eating to enjoy the sport of the search On the first page there were only some scraps of writing such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice One was the same as the tattoo mark Billy Bones his fancy then there was Mr W Bones mate No more rum Off Palm Key he got itt and some other snatches mostly single words and unintelligible I could not help wondering who it was that had got itt and what itt was that he got A knife in his back as like as not
Not much instruction there said Dr Livesey as he passed on
The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money as in common account-books but instead of explanatory writing only a varying number of crosses between the two On the th of June  for instance a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause In a few cases to be sure the name of a place would be added as Offe Caraccas or a mere entry of latitude and longitude as o   o  
The record lasted over nearly twenty years the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions and these words appended Bones his pile
I cant make head or tail of this said Dr Livesey
The thing is as clear as noonday cried the squire This is the black-hearted hounds account-book These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered The sums are the scoundrels share and where he feared an ambiguity you see he added something clearer Offe Caraccas now you see here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast God help the poor souls that manned hercoral long ago
Right said the doctor See what it is to be a traveller Right And the amounts increase you see as he rose in rank
There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French English and Spanish moneys to a common value
Thrifty man cried the doctor He wasnt the one to be cheated
And now said the squire for the other
The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal the very thimble perhaps that I had found in the captains pocket The doctor opened the seals with great care and there fell out the map of an island with latitude and longitude soundings names of hills and bays and inlets and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores It was about nine miles long and five across shaped you might say like a fat dragon standing up and had two fine land-locked harbours and a hill in the centre part marked The Spy-glass There were several additions of a later date but above all three crosses of red inktwo on the north part of the island one in the southwestand beside this last in the same red ink and in a small neat hand very different from the captains tottery characters these words Bulk of treasure here
Over on the back the same hand had written this further information
That was all but brief as it was and to me incomprehensible it filled the squire and Dr Livesey with delight
Livesey said the squire you will give up this wretched practice at once Tomorrow I start for Bristol In three weeks timethree weekstwo weeksten dayswell have the best ship sir and the choicest crew in England Hawkins shall come as cabin-boy Youll make a famous cabin-boy Hawkins You Livesey are ships doctor I am admiral Well take Redruth Joyce and Hunter Well have favourable winds a quick passage and not the least difficulty in finding the spot and money to eat to roll in to play duck and drake with ever after
Trelawney said the doctor Ill go with you and Ill go bail for it so will Jim and be a credit to the undertaking Theres only one man Im afraid of
And whos that cried the squire Name the dog sir
You replied the doctor for you cannot hold your tongue We are not the only men who know of this paper These fellows who attacked the inn tonightbold desperate blades for sureand the rest who stayed aboard that lugger and more I dare say not far off are one and all through thick and thin bound that theyll get that money We must none of us go alone till we get to sea Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile youll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol and from first to last not one of us must breathe a word of what weve found
Livesey returned the squire you are always in the right of it Ill be as silent as the grave
PART TWOThe Sea-cook
I Go to Bristol
IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea and none of our first plansnot even Dr Liveseys of keeping me beside himcould be carried out as we intended The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice the squire was hard at work at Bristol and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth the gamekeeper almost a prisoner but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures I brooded by the hour together over the map all the details of which I well remembered Sitting by the fire in the housekeepers room I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction I explored every acre of its surface I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects Sometimes the isle was thick with savages with whom we fought sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures
So the weeks passed on till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr Livesey with this addition To be opened in the case of his absence by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins Obeying this order we found or rather I foundfor the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but printthe following important news
Old Anchor Inn Bristol March  --
Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London I send this in double to both places
The ship is bought and fitted She lies at anchor ready for sea You never imagined a sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two hundred tons name HISPANIOLA
I got her through my old friend Blandly who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest and so I may say did everyone in Bristol as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for--treasure I mean
Redruth said I interrupting the letter Dr Livesey will not like that The squire has been talking after all
Well whos a better right growled the gamekeeper A pretty rum go if squire aint to talk for Dr Livesey I should think
At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on
Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him and that he sold it me absurdly high--the most transparent calumnies None of them dare however to deny the merits of the ship
So far there was not a hitch The workpeople to be sure--riggers and what not--were most annoyingly slow but time cured that It was the crew that troubled me
I wished a round score of men--in case of natives buccaneers or the odious French--and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required
I was standing on the dock when by the merest accident I fell in talk with him I found he was an old sailor kept a public-house knew all the seafaring men in Bristol had lost his health ashore and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again He had hobbled down there that morning he said to get a smell of the salt
I was monstrously touched--so would you have been--and out of pure pity I engaged him on the spot to be ships cook Long John Silver he is called and has lost a leg but that I regarded as a recommendation since he lost it in his countrys service under the immortal Hawke He has no pension Livesey Imagine the abominable age we live in
Well sir I thought I had only found a cook but it was a crew I had discovered Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not pretty to look at but fellows by their faces of the most indomitable spirit I declare we could fight a frigate
Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance
I am in the most magnificent health and spirits eating like a bull sleeping like a tree yet I shall not enjoy a moment till I hear my old tarpaulins tramping round the capstan Seaward ho Hang the treasure Its the glory of the sea that has turned my head So now Livesey come post do not lose an hour if you respect me
Let young Hawkins go at once to see his mother with Redruth for a guard and then both come full speed to Bristol John Trelawney
Postscript--I did not tell you that Blandly who by the way is to send a consort after us if we dont turn up by the end of August had found an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff man which I regret but in all other respects a treasure Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate a man named Arrow I have a boatswain who pipes Livesey so things shall go man-o-war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA
I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance I know of my own knowledge that he has a bankers account which has never been overdrawn He leaves his wife to manage the inn and as she is a woman of colour a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife quite as much as the health that sends him back to roving J T
PPS--Hawkins may stay one night with his mother J T
You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me I was half beside myself with glee and if ever I despised a man it was old Tom Redruth who could do nothing but grumble and lament Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him but such was not the squires pleasure and the squires pleasure was like law among them all Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble
The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow and there I found my mother in good health and spirits The captain who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort was gone where the wicked cease from troubling The squire had had everything repaired and the public rooms and the sign repainted and had added some furnitureabove all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone
It was on seeing that boy that I understood for the first time my situation I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me not at all of the home that I was leaving and now at sight of this clumsy stranger who was to stay here in my place beside my mother I had my first attack of tears I am afraid I led that boy a dogs life for as he was new to the work I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down and I was not slow to profit by them
The night passed and the next day after dinner Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born and the dear old Admiral Benbowsince he was repainted no longer quite so dear One of my last thoughts was of the captain who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat his sabre-cut cheek and his old brass telescope Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight
The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air I must have dozed a great deal from the very first and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time
Where are we I asked
Bristol said Tom Get down
Mr Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner Thither we had now to walk and our way to my great delight lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations In one sailors were singing at their work in another there were men aloft high over my head hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spiders Though I had lived by the shore all my life I seemed never to have been near the sea till then The smell of tar and salt was something new I saw the most wonderful figureheads that had all been far over the ocean I saw besides many old sailors with rings in their ears and whiskers curled in ringlets and tarry pigtails and their swaggering clumsy sea-walk and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted
And I was going to sea myself to sea in a schooner with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen to sea bound for an unknown island and to seek for buried treasure
While I was still in this delightful dream we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney all dressed out like a sea-officer in stout blue cloth coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailors walk
Here you are he cried and the doctor came last night from London Bravo The ships company complete
Oh sir cried I when do we sail
Sail says he We sail tomorrow
At the Sign of the Spy-glass
WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver at the sign of the Spy-glass and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign I set off overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales for the dock was now at its busiest until I found the tavern in question
It was a bright enough little place of entertainment The sign was newly painted the windows had neat red curtains the floor was cleanly sanded There was a street on each side and an open door on both which made the large low room pretty clear to see in in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke
The customers were mostly seafaring men and they talked so loudly that I hung at the door almost afraid to enter
As I was waiting a man came out of a side room and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John His left leg was cut off close by the hip and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch which he managed with wonderful dexterity hopping about upon it like a bird He was very tall and strong with a face as big as a hamplain and pale but intelligent and smiling Indeed he seemed in the most cheerful spirits whistling as he moved about among the tables with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests
Now to tell you the truth from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawneys letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow But one look at the man before me was enough I had seen the captain and Black Dog and the blind man Pew and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was likea very different creature according to me from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord
I plucked up courage at once crossed the threshold and walked right up to the man where he stood propped on his crutch talking to a customer
Mr Silver sir I asked holding out the note
Yes my lad said he such is my name to be sure And who may you be And then as he saw the squires letter he seemed to me to give something almost like a start
Oh said he quite loud and offering his hand I see You are our new cabin-boy pleased I am to see you
And he took my hand in his large firm grasp
Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door It was close by him and he was out in the street in a moment But his hurry had attracted my notice and I recognized him at glance It was the tallow-faced man wanting two fingers who had come first to the Admiral Benbow
Oh I cried stop him Its Black Dog
I dont care two coppers who he is cried Silver But he hasnt paid his score Harry run and catch him
One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit
If he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score cried Silver and then relinquishing my hand Who did you say he was he asked Black what
Dog sir said I Has Mr Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers He was one of them
So cried Silver In my house Ben run and help Harry One of those swabs was he Was that you drinking with him Morgan Step up here
The man whom he called Morganan old grey-haired mahogany-faced sailorcame forward pretty sheepishly rolling his quid
Now Morgan said Long John very sternly you never clapped your eyes on that BlackBlack Dog before did you now
Not I sir said Morgan with a salute
You didnt know his name did you
No sir
By the powers Tom Morgan its as good for you exclaimed the landlord If you had been mixed up with the like of that you would never have put another foot in my house you may lay to that And what was he saying to you
I dont rightly know sir answered Morgan
Do you call that a head on your shoulders or a blessed dead-eye cried Long John Dont rightly know dont you Perhaps you dont happen to rightly know who you was speaking to perhaps Come now what was he jawingvyages capns ships Pipe up What was it
We was a-talkin of keel-hauling answered Morgan
Keel-hauling was you And a mighty suitable thing too and you may lay to that Get back to your place for a lubber Tom
And then as Morgan rolled back to his seat Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering as I thought Hes quite an honest man Tom Morgan ony stupid And now he ran on again aloud lets seeBlack Dog No I dont know the name not I Yet I kind of think Iveyes Ive seen the swab He used to come here with a blind beggar he used
That he did you may be sure said I I knew that blind man too His name was Pew
It was cried Silver now quite excited Pew That were his name for certain Ah he looked a shark he did If we run down this Black Dog now therell be news for Capn Trelawney Bens a good runner few seamen run better than Ben He should run him down hand over hand by the powers He talked o keel-hauling did he ILL keel-haul him
All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch slapping tables with his hand and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy-glass and I watched the cook narrowly But he was too deep and too ready and too clever for me and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd and been scolded like thieves I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver
See here now Hawkins said he heres a blessed hard thing on a man like me now aint it Theres Capn Trelawneywhats he to think Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum Here you comes and tells me of it plain and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights Now Hawkins you do me justice with the capn Youre a lad you are but youre as smart as paint I see that when you first come in Now here it is What could I do with this old timber I hobble on When I was an A B master mariner Id have come up alongside of him hand over hand and broached him to in a brace of old shakes I would but now
And then all of a sudden he stopped and his jaw dropped as though he had remembered something
The score he burst out Three goes o rum Why shiver my timbers if I hadnt forgotten my score
And falling on a bench he laughed until the tears ran down his cheeks I could not help joining and we laughed together peal after peal until the tavern rang again
Why what a precious old sea-calf I am he said at last wiping his cheeks You and me should get on well Hawkins for Ill take my davy I should be rated ships boy But come now stand by to go about This wont do Dooty is dooty messmates Ill put on my old cockerel hat and step along of you to Capn Trelawney and report this here affair For mind you its serious young Hawkins and neither you nor mes come out of it with what I should make so bold as to call credit Nor you neither says you not smartnone of the pair of us smart But dash my buttons That was a good un about my score
And he began to laugh again and that so heartily that though I did not see the joke as he did I was again obliged to join him in his mirth
On our little walk along the quays he made himself the most interesting companion telling me about the different ships that we passed by their rig tonnage and nationality explaining the work that was going forwardhow one was discharging another taking in cargo and a third making ready for seaand every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates
When we got to the inn the squire and Dr Livesey were seated together finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection
Long John told the story from first to last with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth That was how it were now werent it Hawkins he would say now and again and I could always bear him entirely out
The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away but we all agreed there was nothing to be done and after he had been complimented Long John took up his crutch and departed
All hands aboard by four this afternoon shouted the squire after him
Aye aye sir cried the cook in the passage
Well squire said Dr Livesey I dont put much faith in your discoveries as a general thing but I will say this John Silver suits me
The mans a perfect trump declared the squire
And now added the doctor Jim may come on board with us may he not
To be sure he may says squire Take your hat Hawkins and well see the ship
Powder and Arms
THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel and sometimes swung above us At last however we got alongside and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate Mr Arrow a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint He and the squire were very thick and friendly but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr Trelawney and the captain
This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us
Captain Smollett sir axing to speak with you said he
I am always at the captains orders Show him in said the squire
The captain who was close behind his messenger entered at once and shut the door behind him
Well Captain Smollett what have you to say All well I hope all shipshape and seaworthy
Well sir said the captain better speak plain I believe even at the risk of offence I dont like this cruise I dont like the men and I dont like my officer Thats short and sweet
Perhaps sir you dont like the ship inquired the squire very angry as I could see
I cant speak as to that sir not having seen her tried said the captain She seems a clever craft more I cant say
Possibly sir you may not like your employer either says the squire
But here Dr Livesey cut in
Stay a bit said he stay a bit No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling The captain has said too much or he has said too little and Im bound to say that I require an explanation of his words You dont you say like this cruise Now why
I was engaged sir on what we call sealed orders to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me said the captain So far so good But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do I dont call that fair now do you
No said Dr Livesey I dont
Next said the captain I learn we are going after treasurehear it from my own hands mind you Now treasure is ticklish work I dont like treasure voyages on any account and I dont like them above all when they are secret and when begging your pardon Mr Trelawney the secret has been told to the parrot
Silvers parrot asked the squire
Its a way of speaking said the captain Blabbed I mean Its my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about but Ill tell you my way of itlife or death and a close run
That is all clear and I dare say true enough replied Dr Livesey We take the risk but we are not so ignorant as you believe us Next you say you dont like the crew Are they not good seamen
I dont like them sir returned Captain Smollett And I think I should have had the choosing of my own hands if you go to that
Perhaps you should replied the doctor My friend should perhaps have taken you along with him but the slight if there be one was unintentional And you dont like Mr Arrow
I dont sir I believe hes a good seaman but hes too free with the crew to be a good officer A mate should keep himself to himselfshouldnt drink with the men before the mast
Do you mean he drinks cried the squire
No sir replied the captain only that hes too familiar
Well now and the short and long of it captain asked the doctor Tell us what you want
Well gentlemen are you determined to go on this cruise
Like iron answered the squire
Very good said the captain Then as youve heard me very patiently saying things that I could not prove hear me a few words more They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold Now you have a good place under the cabin why not put them therefirst point Then you are bringing four of your own people with you and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward Why not give them the berths here beside the cabinsecond point
Any more asked Mr Trelawney
One more said the captain Theres been too much blabbing already
Far too much agreed the doctor
Ill tell you what Ive heard myself continued Captain Smollett that you have a map of an island that theres crosses on the map to show where treasure is and that the island lies And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly
I never told that cried the squire to a soul
The hands know it sir returned the captain
Livesey that must have been you or Hawkins cried the squire
It doesnt much matter who it was replied the doctor And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr Trelawneys protestations Neither did I to be sure he was so loose a talker yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island
Well gentlemen continued the captain I dont know who has this map but I make it a point it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr Arrow Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign
I see said the doctor You wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship manned with my friends own people and provided with all the arms and powder on board In other words you fear a mutiny
Sir said Captain Smollett with no intention to take offence I deny your right to put words into my mouth No captain sir would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that As for Mr Arrow I believe him thoroughly honest some of the men are the same all may be for what I know But I am responsible for the ships safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her I see things going as I think not quite right And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth And thats all
Captain Smollett began the doctor with a smile did ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse Youll excuse me I dare say but you remind me of that fable When you came in here Ill stake my wig you meant more than this
Doctor said the captain you are smart When I came in here I meant to get discharged I had no thought that Mr Trelawney would hear a word
No more I would cried the squire Had Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce As it is I have heard you I will do as you desire but I think the worse of you
Thats as you please sir said the captain Youll find I do my duty
And with that he took his leave
Trelawney said the doctor contrary to all my notions I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with youthat man and John Silver
Silver if you like cried the squire but as for that intolerable humbug I declare I think his conduct unmanly unsailorly and downright un-English
Well says the doctor we shall see
When we came on deck the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder yo-ho-ing at their work while the captain and Mr Arrow stood by superintending
The new arrangement was quite to my liking The whole schooner had been overhauled six berths had been made astern out of what had been the after-part of the main hold and this set of cabins was only joined to the galley and forecastle by a sparred passage on the port side It had been originally meant that the captain Mr Arrow Hunter Joyce the doctor and the squire were to occupy these six berths Now Redruth and I were to get two of them and Mr Arrow and the captain were to sleep on deck in the companion which had been enlarged on each side till you might almost have called it a round-house Very low it was still of course but there was room to swing two hammocks and even the mate seemed pleased with the arrangement Even he perhaps had been doubtful as to the crew but that is only guess for as you shall hear we had not long the benefit of his opinion
We were all hard at work changing the powder and the berths when the last man or two and Long John along with them came off in a shore-boat
The cook came up the side like a monkey for cleverness and as soon as he saw what was doing So ho mates says he Whats this
Were a-changing of the powder Jack answers one
Why by the powers cried Long John if we do well miss the morning tide
My orders said the captain shortly You may go below my man Hands will want supper
Aye aye sir answered the cook and touching his forelock he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley
Thats a good man captain said the doctor
Very likely sir replied Captain Smollett Easy with that meneasy he ran on to the fellows who were shifting the powder and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships a long brass nine Here you ships boy he cried out o that Off with you to the cook and get some work
And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say quite loudly to the doctor Ill have no favourites on my ship
I assure you I was quite of the squires way of thinking and hated the captain deeply
The Voyage
ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place and boatfuls of the squires friends Mr Blandly and the like coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work and I was dog-tired when a little before dawn the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars I might have been twice as weary yet I would not have left the deck all was so new and interesting to methe brief commands the shrill note of the whistle the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ships lanterns
Now Barbecue tip us a stave cried one voice
The old one cried another
Aye aye mates said Long John who was standing by with his crutch under his arm and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well
Fifteen men on the dead mans chest
And then the whole crew bore chorus
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum
And at the third Ho drove the bars before them with a will
Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus But soon the anchor was short up soon it was hanging dripping at the bows soon the sails began to draw and the land and shipping to flit by on either side and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure
I am not going to relate that voyage in detail It was fairly prosperous The ship proved to be a good ship the crew were capable seamen and the captain thoroughly understood his business But before we came the length of Treasure Island two or three things had happened which require to be known
Mr Arrow first of all turned out even worse than the captain had feared He had no command among the men and people did what they pleased with him But that was by no means the worst of it for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye red cheeks stuttering tongue and other marks of drunkenness Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace Sometimes he fell and cut himself sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably
In the meantime we could never make out where he got the drink That was the ships mystery Watch him as we pleased we could do nothing to solve it and when we asked him to his face he would only laugh if he were drunk and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water
He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright so nobody was much surprised nor very sorry when one dark night with a head sea he disappeared entirely and was seen no more
Overboard said the captain Well gentlemen that saves the trouble of putting him in irons
But there we were without a mate and it was necessary of course to advance one of the men The boatswain Job Anderson was the likeliest man aboard and though he kept his old title he served in a way as mate Mr Trelawney had followed the sea and his knowledge made him very useful for he often took a watch himself in easy weather And the coxswain Israel Hands was a careful wily old experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything
He was a great confidant of Long John Silver and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ships cook Barbecue as the men called him
Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck to have both hands as free as possible It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead and propped against it yielding to every movement of the ship get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spacesLong Johns earrings they were called and he would hand himself from one place to another now using the crutch now trailing it alongside by the lanyard as quickly as another man could walk Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced
Hes no common man Barbecue said the coxswain to me He had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded and bravea lions nothing alongside of Long John I seen him grapple four and knock their heads togetherhim unarmed
All the crew respected and even obeyed him He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service To me he was unweariedly kind and always glad to see me in the galley which he kept as clean as a new pin the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner
Come away Hawkins he would say come and have a yarn with John Nobody more welcome than yourself my son Sit you down and hear the news Heres Capn FlintI calls my parrot Capn Flint after the famous buccaneerheres Capn Flint predicting success to our vyage Wasnt you capn
And the parrot would say with great rapidity Pieces of eight Pieces of eight Pieces of eight till you wondered that it was not out of breath or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage
Now that bird he would say is maybe two hundred years old Hawkinsthey live forever mostly and if anybodys seen more wickedness it must be the devil himself Shes sailed with England the great Capn England the pirate Shes been at Madagascar and at Malabar and Surinam and Providence and Portobello She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships Its there she learned Pieces of eight and little wonder three hundred and fifty thousand of em Hawkins She was at the boarding of the viceroy of the Indies out of Goa she was and to look at her you would think she was a babby But you smelt powderdidnt you capn
Stand by to go about the parrot would scream
Ah shes a handsome craft she is the cook would say and give her sugar from his pocket and then the bird would peck at the bars and swear straight on passing belief for wickedness There John would add you cant touch pitch and not be mucked lad Heres this poor old innocent bird o mine swearing blue fire and none the wiser you may lay to that She would swear the same in a manner of speaking before chaplain And John would touch his forelock with a solemn way he had that made me think he was the best of men
In the meantime the squire and Captain Smollett were still on pretty distant terms with one another The squire made no bones about the matter he despised the captain The captain on his part never spoke but when he was spoken to and then sharp and short and dry and not a word wasted He owned when driven into a corner that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well As for the ship he had taken a downright fancy to her Shell lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife sir But he would add all I say is were not home again and I dont like the cruise
The squire at this would turn away and march up and down the deck chin in air
A trifle more of that man he would say and I shall explode
We had some heavy weather which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA Every man on board seemed well content and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise for it is my belief there was never a ships company so spoiled since Noah put to sea Double grog was going on the least excuse there was duff on odd days as for instance if the squire heard it was any mans birthday and always a barrel of apples standing broached in the waist for anyone to help himself that had a fancy
Never knew good come of it yet the captain said to Dr Livesey Spoil forecastle hands make devils Thats my belief
But good did come of the apple barrel as you shall hear for if it had not been for that we should have had no note of warning and might all have perished by the hand of treachery
This was how it came about
We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were afterI am not allowed to be more plainand now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation some time that night or at latest before noon of the morrow we should sight the Treasure Island We were heading SSW and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray All was drawing alow and aloft everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure
Now just after sundown when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth it occurred to me that I should like an apple I ran on deck The watch was all forward looking out for the island The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship
In I got bodily into the apple barrel and found there was scarce an apple left but sitting down there in the dark what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak It was Silvers voice and before I had heard a dozen words I would not have shown myself for all the world but lay there trembling and listening in the extreme of fear and curiosity for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone
What I Heard in the Apple Barrel
NO not I said Silver Flint was capn I was quartermaster along of my timber leg The same broadside I lost my leg old Pew lost his deadlights It was a master surgeon him that ampytated meout of college and allLatin by the bucket and what not but he was hanged like a dog and sun-dried like the rest at Corso Castle That was Roberts men that was and comed of changing names to their shipsROYAL FORTUNE and so on Now what a ship was christened so let her stay I says So it was with the CASSANDRA as brought us all safe home from Malabar after England took the viceroy of the Indies so it was with the old WALRUS Flints old ship as Ive seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold
Ah cried another voice that of the youngest hand on board and evidently full of admiration He was the flower of the flock was Flint
Davis was a man too by all accounts said Silver I never sailed along of him first with England then with Flint thats my story and now here on my own account in a manner of speaking I laid by nine hundred safe from England and two thousand after Flint That aint bad for a man before the mastall safe in bank Taint earning now its saving does it you may lay to that Wheres all Englands men now I dunno Wheres Flints Why most on em aboard here and glad to get the duffbeen begging before that some on em Old Pew as had lost his sight and might have thought shame spends twelve hundred pound in a year like a lord in Parliament Where is he now Well hes dead now and under hatches but for two year before that shiver my timbers the man was starving He begged and he stole and he cut throats and starved at that by the powers
Well it aint much use after all said the young seaman
Taint much use for fools you may lay to itthat nor nothing cried Silver But now you look here youre young you are but youre as smart as paint I see that when I set my eyes on you and Ill talk to you like a man
You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself I think if I had been able that I would have killed him through the barrel Meantime he ran on little supposing he was overheard
Here it is about gentlemen of fortune They lives rough and they risk swinging but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks and when a cruise is done why its hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets Now the most goes for rum and a good fling and to sea again in their shirts But thats not the course I lay I puts it all away some here some there and none too much anywheres by reason of suspicion Im fifty mark you once back from this cruise I set up gentleman in earnest Time enough too says you Ah but Ive lived easy in the meantime never denied myself o nothing heart desires and slep soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea And how did I begin Before the mast like you
Well said the other but all the other moneys gone now aint it You darent show face in Bristol after this
Why where might you suppose it was asked Silver derisively
At Bristol in banks and places answered his companion
It were said the cook it were when we weighed anchor But my old missis has it all by now And the Spy-glass is sold lease and goodwill and rigging and the old girls off to meet me I would tell you where for I trust you but itd make jealousy among the mates
And can you trust your missis asked the other
Gentlemen of fortune returned the cook usually trusts little among themselves and right they are you may lay to it But I have a way with me I have When a mate brings a slip on his cableone as knows me I meanit wont be in the same world with old John There was some that was feared of Pew and some that was feared of Flint but Flint his own self was feared of me Feared he was and proud They was the roughest crew afloat was Flints the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them Well now I tell you Im not a boasting man and you seen yourself how easy I keep company but when I was quartermaster LAMBS wasnt the word for Flints old buccaneers Ah you may be sure of yourself in old Johns ship
Well I tell you now replied the lad I didnt half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you John but theres my hand on it now
And a brave lad you were and smart too answered Silver shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook and a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on
By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms By a gentleman of fortune they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest handsperhaps of the last one left aboard But on this point I was soon to be relieved for Silver giving a little whistle a third man strolled up and sat down by the party
Dicks square said Silver
Oh I knowd Dick was square returned the voice of the coxswain Israel Hands Hes no fool is Dick And he turned his quid and spat But look here he went on heres what I want to know Barbecue how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat Ive had amost enough o Capn Smollett hes hazed me long enough by thunder I want to go into that cabin I do I want their pickles and wines and that
Israel said Silver your head aint much account nor ever was But youre able to hear I reckon leastways your ears is big enough Now heres what I say youll berth forward and youll live hard and youll speak soft and youll keep sober till I give the word and you may lay to that my son
Well I dont say no do I growled the coxswain What I say is when Thats what I say
When By the powers cried Silver Well now if you want to know Ill tell you when The last moment I can manage and thats when Heres a first-rate seaman Capn Smollett sails the blessed ship for us Heres this squire and doctor with a map and suchI dont know where it is do I No more do you says you Well then I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff and help us to get it aboard by the powers Then well see If I was sure of you all sons of double Dutchmen Id have Capn Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck
Why were all seamen aboard here I should think said the lad Dick
Were all forecastle hands you mean snapped Silver We can steer a course but whos to set one Thats what all you gentlemen split on first and last If I had my way Id have Capn Smollett work us back into the trades at least then wed have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day But I know the sort you are Ill finish with em at the island as soons the blunts on board and a pity it is But youre never happy till youre drunk Split my sides Ive a sick heart to sail with the likes of you
Easy all Long John cried Israel Whos a-crossin of you
Why how many tall ships think ye now have I seen laid aboard And how many brisk lads drying in the sun at Execution Dock cried Silver And all for this same hurry and hurry and hurry You hear me I seen a thing or two at sea I have If you would ony lay your course and a pint to windward you would ride in carriages you would But not you I know you Youll have your mouthful of rum tomorrow and go hang
Everybody knowed you was a kind of a chapling John but theres others as could hand and steer as well as you said Israel They liked a bit o fun they did They wasnt so high and dry nohow but took their fling like jolly companions every one
So says Silver Well and where are they now Pew was that sort and he died a beggar-man Flint was and he died of rum at Savannah Ah they was a sweet crew they was Ony where are they
But asked Dick when we do lay em athwart what are we to do with em anyhow
Theres the man for me cried the cook admiringly Thats what I call business Well what would you think Put em ashore like maroons That would have been Englands way Or cut em down like that much pork That would have been Flints or Billy Boness
Billy was the man for that said Israel Dead men dont bite says he Well hes dead now hisself he knows the long and short on it now and if ever a rough hand come to port it was Billy
Right you are said Silver rough and ready But mark you here Im an easy manIm quite the gentleman says you but this time its serious Dooty is dooty mates I give my votedeath When Im in Parlyment and riding in my coach I dont want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home unlooked for like the devil at prayers Wait is what I say but when the time comes why let her rip
John cries the coxswain youre a man
Youll say so Israel when you see said Silver Only one thing I claimI claim Trelawney Ill wring his calfs head off his body with these hands Dick he added breaking off You just jump up like a sweet lad and get me an apple to wet my pipe like
You may fancy the terror I was in I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength but my limbs and heart alike misgave me I heard Dick begin to rise and then someone seemingly stopped him and the voice of Hands exclaimed Oh stow that Dont you get sucking of that bilge John Lets have a go of the rum
Dick said Silver I trust you Ive a gauge on the keg mind Theres the key you fill a pannikin and bring it up
Terrified as I was I could not help thinking to myself that this must have been how Mr Arrow got the strong waters that destroyed him
Dick was gone but a little while and during his absence Israel spoke straight on in the cooks ear It was but a word or two that I could catch and yet I gathered some important news for besides other scraps that tended to the same purpose this whole clause was audible Not another man of themll jine Hence there were still faithful men on board
When Dick returned one after another of the trio took the pannikin and drankone To luck another with a Heres to old Flint and Silver himself saying in a kind of song Heres to ourselves and hold your luff plenty of prizes and plenty of duff
Just then a sort of brightness fell upon me in the barrel and looking up I found the moon had risen and was silvering the mizzen-top and shining white on the luff of the fore-sail and almost at the same time the voice of the lookout shouted Land ho
Council of War
THERE was a great rush of feet across the deck I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle and slipping in an instant outside my barrel I dived behind the fore-sail made a double towards the stern and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr Livesey in the rush for the weather bow
There all hands were already congregated A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills about a couple of miles apart and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill whose peak was still buried in the fog All three seemed sharp and conical in figure
So much I saw almost in a dream for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east
And now men said the captain when all was sheeted home has any one of you ever seen that land ahead
I have sir said Silver Ive watered there with a trader I was cook in
The anchorage is on the south behind an islet I fancy asked the captain
Yes sir Skeleton Island they calls it It were a main place for pirates once and a hand we had on board knowed all their names for it That hill to the norard they calls the Fore-mast Hill there are three hills in a row running southardfore main and mizzen sir But the mainthats the big un with the cloud on itthey usually calls the Spy-glass by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the anchorage cleaning for its there they cleaned their ships sir asking your pardon
I have a chart here says Captain Smollett See if thats the place
Long Johns eyes burned in his head as he took the chart but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment This was not the map we found in Billy Boness chest but an accurate copy complete in all thingsnames and heights and soundingswith the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes Sharp as must have been his annoyance Silver had the strength of mind to hide it
Yes sir said he this is the spot to be sure and very prettily drawed out Who might have done that I wonder The pirates were too ignorant I reckon Aye here it is Capt Kidds Anchoragejust the name my shipmate called it Theres a strong current runs along the south and then away norard up the west coast Right you was sir says he to haul your wind and keep the weather of the island Leastways if such was your intention as to enter and careen and there aint no better place for that in these waters
Thank you my man says Captain Smollett Ill ask you later on to give us a help You may go
I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself He did not know to be sure that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty duplicity and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm
Ah says he this here is a sweet spot this islanda sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on Youll bathe and youll climb trees and youll hunt goats you will and youll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself Why it makes me young again I was going to forget my timber leg I was Its a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes and you may lay to that When you want to go a bit of exploring you just ask old John and hell put up a snack for you to take along
And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder he hobbled off forward and went below
Captain Smollett the squire and Dr Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck and anxious as I was to tell them my story I durst not interrupt them openly While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse Dr Livesey called me to his side He had left his pipe below and being a slave to tobacco had meant that I should fetch it but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard I broke immediately Doctor let me speak Get the captain and squire down to the cabin and then make some pretence to send for me I have terrible news
The doctor changed countenance a little but next moment he was master of himself
Thank you Jim said he quite loudly that was all I wanted to know as if he had asked me a question
And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two They spoke together for a little and though none of them started or raised his voice or so much as whistled it was plain enough that Dr Livesey had communicated my request for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson and all hands were piped on deck
My lads said Captain Smollett Ive a word to say to you This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for Mr Trelawney being a very open-handed gentleman as we all know has just asked me a word or two and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty alow and aloft as I never ask to see it done better why he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck and youll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck Ill tell you what I think of this I think it handsome And if you think as I do youll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it
The cheer followedthat was a matter of course but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood
One more cheer for Capn Smollett cried Long John when the first had subsided
And this also was given with a will
On the top of that the three gentlemen went below and not long after word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin
I found them all three seated round the table a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them and the doctor smoking away with his wig on his lap and that I knew was a sign that he was agitated The stern window was open for it was a warm night and you could see the moon shining behind on the ships wake
Now Hawkins said the squire you have something to say Speak up
I did as I was bid and as short as I could make it told the whole details of Silvers conversation Nobody interrupted me till I was done nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last
Jim said Dr Livesey take a seat
And they made me sit down at table beside them poured me out a glass of wine filled my hands with raisins and all three one after the other and each with a bow drank my good health and their service to me for my luck and courage
Now captain said the squire you were right and I was wrong I own myself an ass and I await your orders
No more an ass than I sir returned the captain I never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according But this crew he added beats me
Captain said the doctor with your permission thats Silver A very remarkable man
Hed look remarkably well from a yard-arm sir returned the captain But this is talk this dont lead to anything I see three or four points and with Mr Trelawneys permission Ill name them
You sir are the captain It is for you to speak says Mr Trelawney grandly
First point began Mr Smollett We must go on because we cant turn back If I gave the word to go about they would rise at once Second point we have time before usat least until this treasures found Third point there are faithful hands Now sir its got to come to blows sooner or later and what I propose is to take time by the forelock as the saying is and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it We can count I take it on your own home servants Mr Trelawney
As upon myself declared the squire
Three reckoned the captain ourselves make seven counting Hawkins here Now about the honest hands
Most likely Trelawneys own men said the doctor those he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver
Nay replied the squire Hands was one of mine
I did think I could have trusted Hands added the captain
And to think that theyre all Englishmen broke out the squire Sir I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up
Well gentlemen said the captain the best that I can say is not much We must lay to if you please and keep a bright lookout Its trying on a man I know It would be pleasanter to come to blows But theres no help for it till we know our men Lay to and whistle for a wind thats my view
Jim here said the doctor can help us more than anyone The men are not shy with him and Jim is a noticing lad
Hawkins I put prodigious faith in you added the squire
I began to feel pretty desperate at this for I felt altogether helpless and yet by an odd train of circumstances it was indeed through me that safety came In the meantime talk as we pleased there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely and out of these seven one was a boy so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen
PART THREEMy Shore Adventure
How My Shore Adventure Began
THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed Although the breeze had now utterly ceased we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands and by many tall trees of the pine family out-topping the otherssome singly some in clumps but the general colouring was uniform and sad The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock All were strangely shaped and the Spy-glass which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island was likewise the strangest in configuration running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on
The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell The booms were tearing at the blocks the rudder was banging to and fro and the whole ship creaking groaning and jumping like a manufactory I had to cling tight to the backstay and the world turned giddily before my eyes for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so above all in the morning on an empty stomach
Perhaps it was thisperhaps it was the look of the island with its grey melancholy woods and wild stone spires and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beachat least although the sun shone bright and hot and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea my heart sank as the saying is into my boots and from the first look onward I hated the very thought of Treasure Island
We had a dreary mornings work before us for there was no sign of any wind and the boats had to be got out and manned and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island I volunteered for one of the boats where I had of course no business The heat was sweltering and the men grumbled fiercely over their work Anderson was in command of my boat and instead of keeping the crew in order he grumbled as loud as the worst
Well he said with an oath its not forever
I thought this was a very bad sign for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline
All the way in Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship He knew the passage like the palm of his hand and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart John never hesitated once
Theres a strong scour with the ebb he said and this here passage has been dug out in a manner of speaking with a spade
We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart about a third of a mile from each shore the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other The bottom was clean sand The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent
The place was entirely land-locked buried in woods the trees coming right down to high-water mark the shores mostly flat and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre one here one there Two little rivers or rather two swamps emptied out into this pond as you might call it and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness From the ship we could see nothing of the house or stockade for they were quite buried among trees and if it had not been for the chart on the companion we might have been the first that had ever anchored there since the island arose out of the seas
There was not a breath of air moving nor a sound but that of the surf booming half a mile away along the beaches and against the rocks outside A peculiar stagnant smell hung over the anchoragea smell of sodden leaves and rotting tree trunks I observed the doctor sniffing and sniffing like someone tasting a bad egg
I dont know about treasure he said but Ill stake my wig theres fever here
If the conduct of the men had been alarming in the boat it became truly threatening when they had come aboard They lay about the deck growling together in talk The slightest order was received with a black look and grudgingly and carelessly obeyed Even the honest hands must have caught the infection for there was not one man aboard to mend another Mutiny it was plain hung over us like a thunder-cloud
And it was not only we of the cabin party who perceived the danger Long John was hard at work going from group to group spending himself in good advice and as for example no man could have shown a better He fairly outstripped himself in willingness and civility he was all smiles to everyone If an order were given John would be on his crutch in an instant with the cheeriest Aye aye sir in the world and when there was nothing else to do he kept up one song after another as if to conceal the discontent of the rest
Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst
We held a council in the cabin
Sir said the captain if I risk another order the whole shipll come about our ears by the run You see sir here it is I get a rough answer do I not Well if I speak back pikes will be going in two shakes if I dont Silver will see theres something under that and the games up Now weve only one man to rely on
And who is that asked the squire
Silver sir returned the captain hes as anxious as you and I to smother things up This is a tiff hed soon talk em out of it if he had the chance and what I propose to do is to give him the chance Lets allow the men an afternoon ashore If they all go why well fight the ship If they none of them go well then we hold the cabin and God defend the right If some go you mark my words sir Silverll bring em aboard again as mild as lambs
It was so decided loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men Hunter Joyce and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew
My lads said he weve had a hot day and are all tired and out of sorts A turn ashorell hurt nobodythe boats are still in the water you can take the gigs and as many as please may go ashore for the afternoon Ill fire a gun half an hour before sundown
I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage
The captain was too bright to be in the way He whipped out of sight in a moment leaving Silver to arrange the party and I fancy it was as well he did so Had he been on deck he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation It was as plain as day Silver was the captain and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it The honest handsand I was soon to see it proved that there were such on boardmust have been very stupid fellows Or rather I suppose the truth was this that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleadersonly some more some less and a few being good fellows in the main could neither be led nor driven any further It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men
At last however the party was made up Six fellows were to stay on board and the remaining thirteen including Silver began to embark
Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives If six men were left by Silver it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship and since only six were left it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance It occurred to me at once to go ashore In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat and almost at the same moment she shoved off
No one took notice of me only the bow oar saying Is that you Jim Keep your head down But Silver from the other boat looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me and from that moment I began to regret what I had done
The crews raced for the beach but the boat I was in having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned shot far ahead of her consort and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind
Jim Jim I heard him shouting
But you may suppose I paid no heed jumping ducking and breaking through I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer
The First Blow
I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in
I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows bulrushes and odd outlandish swampy trees and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating sandy country about a mile long dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees not unlike the oak in growth but pale in the foliage like willows On the far side of the open stood one of the hills with two quaint craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun
I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration The isle was uninhabited my shipmates I had left behind and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls I turned hither and thither among the trees Here and there were flowering plants unknown to me here and there I saw snakes and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle
Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike treeslive or evergreen oaks I heard afterwards they should be calledwhich grew low along the sand like brambles the boughs curiously twisted the foliage compact like thatch The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls spreading and growing taller as it went until it reached the margin of the broad reedy fen through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage The marsh was steaming in the strong sun and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze
All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes a wild duck flew up with a quack another followed and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen Nor was I deceived for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice which as I continued to give ear grew steadily louder and nearer
This put me in a great fear and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there hearkening as silent as a mouse
Another voice answered and then the first voice which I now recognized to be Silvers once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream only now and again interrupted by the other By the sound they must have been talking earnestly and almost fiercely but no distinct word came to my hearing
At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down for not only did they cease to draw any nearer but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp
And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees
I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders
Crawling on all fours I made steadily but slowly towards them till at last raising my head to an aperture among the leaves I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh and closely set about with trees where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation
The sun beat full upon them Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground and his great smooth blond face all shining with heat was lifted to the other mans in a kind of appeal
Mate he was saying its because I thinks gold dust of yougold dust and you may lay to that If I hadnt took to you like pitch do you think Id have been here a-warning of you Alls upyou cant make nor mend its to save your neck that Im a-speaking and if one of the wild uns knew it whered I be Tomnow tell me whered I be
Silver said the other manand I observed he was not only red in the face but spoke as hoarse as a crow and his voice shook too like a taut ropeSilver says he youre old and youre honest or has the name for it and youve money too which lots of poor sailors hasnt and youre brave or Im mistook And will you tell me youll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs Not you As sure as God sees me Id sooner lose my hand If I turn agin my dooty
And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise I had found one of the honest handswell here at that same moment came news of another Far away out in the marsh there arose all of a sudden a sound like the cry of anger then another on the back of it and then one horrid long-drawn scream The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again darkening heaven with a simultaneous whirr and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain silence had re-established its empire and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon
Tom had leaped at the sound like a horse at the spur but Silver had not winked an eye He stood where he was resting lightly on his crutch watching his companion like a snake about to spring
John said the sailor stretching out his hand
Hands off cried Silver leaping back a yard as it seemed to me with the speed and security of a trained gymnast
Hands off if you like John Silver said the other Its a black conscience that can make you feared of me But in heavens name tell me what was that
That returned Silver smiling away but warier than ever his eye a mere pin-point in his big face but gleaming like a crumb of glass That Oh I reckon thatll be Alan
And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero
Alan he cried Then rest his soul for a true seaman And as for you John Silver long youve been a mate of mine but youre mate of mine no more If I die like a dog Ill die in my dooty Youve killed Alan have you Kill me too if you can But I defies you
And with that this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach But he was not destined to go far With a cry John seized the branch of a tree whipped the crutch out of his armpit and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air It struck poor Tom point foremost and with stunning violence right between the shoulders in the middle of his back His hands flew up he gave a sort of gasp and fell
Whether he were injured much or little none could ever tell Like enough to judge from the sound his back was broken on the spot But he had no time given him to recover Silver agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body From my place of ambush I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows
I do not know what it rightly is to faint but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist Silver and the birds and the tall Spy-glass hilltop going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear
When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together his crutch under his arm his hat upon his head Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward but the murderer minded him not a whit cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass Everything else was unchanged the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes
But now John put his hand into his pocket brought out a whistle and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air I could not tell of course the meaning of the signal but it instantly awoke my fears More men would be coming I might be discovered They had already slain two of the honest people after Tom and Alan might not I come next
Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again with what speed and silence I could manage to the more open portion of the wood As I did so I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades and this sound of danger lent me wings As soon as I was clear of the thicket I ran as I never ran before scarce minding the direction of my flight so long as it led me from the murderers and as I ran fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy
Indeed could anyone be more entirely lost than I When the gun fired how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends still smoking from their crime Would not the first of them who saw me wring my neck like a snipes Would not my absence itself be an evidence to them of my alarm and therefore of my fatal knowledge It was all over I thought Good-bye to the HISPANIOLA good-bye to the squire the doctor and the captain There was nothing left for me but death by starvation or death by the hands of the mutineers
All this while as I say I was still running and without taking any notice I had drawn near to the foot of the little hill with the two peaks and had got into a part of the island where the live-oaks grew more widely apart and seemed more like forest trees in their bearing and dimensions Mingled with these were a few scattered pines some fifty some nearer seventy feet high The air too smelt more freshly than down beside the marsh
And here a fresh alarm brought me to a standstill with a thumping heart
The Man of the Island
FROM the side of the hill which was here steep and stony a spout of gravel was dislodged and fell rattling and bounding through the trees My eyes turned instinctively in that direction and I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine What it was whether bear or man or monkey I could in no wise tell It seemed dark and shaggy more I knew not But the terror of this new apparition brought me to a stand
I was now it seemed cut off upon both sides behind me the murderers before me this lurking nondescript And immediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew not Silver himself appeared less terrible in contrast with this creature of the woods and I turned on my heel and looking sharply behind me over my shoulder began to retrace my steps in the direction of the boats
Instantly the figure reappeared and making a wide circuit began to head me off I was tired at any rate but had I been as fresh as when I rose I could see it was in vain for me to contend in speed with such an adversary From trunk to trunk the creature flitted like a deer running manlike on two legs but unlike any man that I had ever seen stooping almost double as it ran Yet a man it was I could no longer be in doubt about that
I began to recall what I had heard of cannibals I was within an ace of calling for help But the mere fact that he was a man however wild had somewhat reassured me and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion I stood still therefore and cast about for some method of escape and as I was so thinking the recollection of my pistol flashed into my mind As soon as I remembered I was not defenceless courage glowed again in my heart and I set my face resolutely for this man of the island and walked briskly towards him
He was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk but he must have been watching me closely for as soon as I began to move in his direction he reappeared and took a step to meet me Then he hesitated drew back came forward again and at last to my wonder and confusion threw himself on his knees and held out his clasped hands in supplication
At that I once more stopped
Who are you I asked
Ben Gunn he answered and his voice sounded hoarse and awkward like a rusty lock Im poor Ben Gunn I am and I havent spoke with a Christian these three years
I could now see that he was a white man like myself and that his features were even pleasing His skin wherever it was exposed was burnt by the sun even his lips were black and his fair eyes looked quite startling in so dark a face Of all the beggar-men that I had seen or fancied he was the chief for raggedness He was clothed with tatters of old ships canvas and old sea-cloth and this extraordinary patchwork was all held together by a system of the most various and incongruous fastenings brass buttons bits of stick and loops of tarry gaskin About his waist he wore an old brass-buckled leather belt which was the one thing solid in his whole accoutrement
Three years I cried Were you shipwrecked
Nay mate said he marooned
I had heard the word and I knew it stood for a horrible kind of punishment common enough among the buccaneers in which the offender is put ashore with a little powder and shot and left behind on some desolate and distant island
Marooned three years agone he continued and lived on goats since then and berries and oysters Wherever a man is says I a man can do for himself But mate my heart is sore for Christian diet You mightnt happen to have a piece of cheese about you now No Well manys the long night Ive dreamed of cheesetoasted mostlyand woke up again and here I were
If ever I can get aboard again said I you shall have cheese by the stone
All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket smoothing my hands looking at my boots and generally in the intervals of his speech showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness
If ever you can get aboard again says you he repeated Why now whos to hinder you
Not you I know was my reply
And right you was he cried Now youwhat do you call yourself mate
Jim I told him
Jim Jim says he quite pleased apparently Well now Jim Ive lived that rough as youd be ashamed to hear of Now for instance you wouldnt think I had had a pious motherto look at me he asked
Why no not in particular I answered
Ah well said he but I hadremarkable pious And I was a civil pious boy and could rattle off my catechism that fast as you couldnt tell one word from another And heres what it come to Jim and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones Thats what it begun with but it went furthern that and so my mother told me and predicked the whole she did the pious woman But it were Providence that put me here Ive thought it all out in this here lonely island and Im back on piety You dont catch me tasting rum so much but just a thimbleful for luck of course the first chance I have Im bound Ill be good and I see the way to And Jimlooking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisperIm rich
I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face for he repeated the statement hotly Rich Rich I says And Ill tell you what Ill make a man of you Jim Ah Jim youll bless your stars you will you was the first that found me
And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes
Now Jim you tell me true that aint Flints ship he asked
At this I had a happy inspiration I began to believe that I had found an ally and I answered him at once
Its not Flints ship and Flint is dead but Ill tell you true as you ask methere are some of Flints hands aboard worse luck for the rest of us
Not a manwith oneleg he gasped
Silver I asked
Ah Silver says he That were his name
Hes the cook and the ringleader too
He was still holding me by the wrist and at that he give it quite a wring
If you was sent by Long John he said Im as good as pork and I know it But where was you do you suppose
I had made my mind up in a moment and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves He heard me with the keenest interest and when I had done he patted me on the head
Youre a good lad Jim he said and youre all in a clove hitch aint you Well you just put your trust in Ben GunnBen Gunns the man to do it Would you think it likely now that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of helphim being in a clove hitch as you remark
I told him the squire was the most liberal of men
Aye but you see returned Ben Gunn I didnt mean giving me a gate to keep and a suit of livery clothes and such thats not my mark Jim What I mean is would he be likely to come down to the toon of say one thousand pounds out of money thats as good as a mans own already
I am sure he would said I As it was all hands were to share
AND a passage home he added with a look of great shrewdness
Why I cried the squires a gentleman And besides if we got rid of the others we should want you to help work the vessel home
Ah said he so you would And he seemed very much relieved
Now Ill tell you what he went on So much Ill tell you and no more I were in Flints ship when he buried the treasure he and six alongsix strong seamen They was ashore nigh on a week and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS One fine day up went the signal and here come Flint by himself in a little boat and his head done up in a blue scarf The sun was getting up and mortal white he looked about the cutwater But there he was you mind and the six all deaddead and buried How he done it not a man aboard us could make out It was battle murder and sudden death leastwayshim against six Billy Bones was the mate Long John he was quartermaster and they asked him where the treasure was Ah says he you can go ashore if you like and stay he says but as for the ship shell beat up for more by thunder Thats what he said
Well I was in another ship three years back and we sighted this island Boys said I heres Flints treasure lets land and find it The capn was displeased at that but my messmates were all of a mind and landed Twelve days they looked for it and every day they had the worse word for me until one fine morning all hands went aboard As for you Benjamin Gunn says they heres a musket they says and a spade and pick-axe You can stay here and find Flints money for yourself they says
Well Jim three years have I been here and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this But now you look here look at me Do I look like a man before the mast No says you Nor I werent neither I says
And with that he winked and pinched me hard
Just you mention them words to your squire Jim he went on Nor he werent neitherthats the words Three years he were the man of this island light and dark fair and rain and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer says you and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother so be as shes alive youll say but the most part of Gunns time this is what youll saythe most part of his time was took up with another matter And then youll give him a nip like I do
And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner
Then he continued then youll up and youll say this Gunn is a good man youll say and he puts a precious sight more confidencea precious sight mind thatin a genleman born than in these genleman of fortune having been one hisself
Well I said I dont understand one word that youve been saying But thats neither here nor there for how am I to get on board
Ah said he thats the hitch for sure Well theres my boat that I made with my two hands I keep her under the white rock If the worst come to the worst we might try that after dark Hi he broke out Whats that
For just then although the sun had still an hour or two to run all the echoes of the island awoke and bellowed to the thunder of a cannon
They have begun to fight I cried Follow me
And I began to run towards the anchorage my terrors all forgotten while close at my side the marooned man in his goatskins trotted easily and lightly
Left left says he keep to your left hand mate Jim Under the trees with you Theers where I killed my first goat They dont come down here now theyre all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn Ah And theres the cetemerycemetery he must have meant You see the mounds I come here and prayed nows and thens when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo It werent quite a chapel but it seemed more solemn like and then says you Ben Gunn was short-handedno chapling nor so much as a Bible and a flag you says
So he kept talking as I ran neither expecting nor receiving any answer
The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms
Another pause and then not a quarter of a mile in front of me I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood
PART FOURThe Stockade
Narrative Continued by the Doctor How the Ship Was Abandoned
IT was about half past onethree bells in the sea phrasethat the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA The captain the squire and I were talking matters over in the cabin Had there been a breath of wind we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us slipped our cable and away to sea But the wind was wanting and to complete our helplessness down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest
It never occurred to us to doubt Jim Hawkins but we were alarmed for his safety With the men in the temper they were in it seemed an even chance if we should see the lad again We ran on deck The pitch was bubbling in the seams the nasty stench of the place turned me sick if ever a man smelt fever and dysentery it was in that abominable anchorage The six scoundrels were sitting grumbling under a sail in the forecastle ashore we could see the gigs made fast and a man sitting in each hard by where the river runs in One of them was whistling Lillibullero
Waiting was a strain and it was decided that Hunter and I should go ashore with the jolly-boat in quest of information
The gigs had leaned to their right but Hunter and I pulled straight in in the direction of the stockade upon the chart The two who were left guarding their boats seemed in a bustle at our appearance Lillibullero stopped off and I could see the pair discussing what they ought to do Had they gone and told Silver all might have turned out differently but they had their orders I suppose and decided to sit quietly where they were and hark back again to Lillibullero
There was a slight bend in the coast and I steered so as to put it between us even before we landed we had thus lost sight of the gigs I jumped out and came as near running as I durst with a big silk handkerchief under my hat for coolness sake and a brace of pistols ready primed for safety
I had not gone a hundred yards when I reached the stockade
This was how it was a spring of clear water rose almost at the top of a knoll Well on the knoll and enclosing the spring they had clapped a stout loghouse fit to hold two score of people on a pinch and loopholed for musketry on either side All round this they had cleared a wide space and then the thing was completed by a paling six feet high without door or opening too strong to pull down without time and labour and too open to shelter the besiegers The people in the log-house had them in every way they stood quiet in shelter and shot the others like partridges All they wanted was a good watch and food for short of a complete surprise they might have held the place against a regiment
What particularly took my fancy was the spring For though we had a good enough place of it in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA with plenty of arms and ammunition and things to eat and excellent wines there had been one thing overlookedwe had no water I was thinking this over when there came ringing over the island the cry of a man at the point of death I was not new to violent deathI have served his Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland and got a wound myself at Fontenoybut I know my pulse went dot and carry one Jim Hawkins is gone was my first thought
It is something to have been an old soldier but more still to have been a doctor There is no time to dilly-dally in our work And so now I made up my mind instantly and with no time lost returned to the shore and jumped on board the jolly-boat
By good fortune Hunter pulled a good oar We made the water fly and the boat was soon alongside and I aboard the schooner
I found them all shaken as was natural The squire was sitting down as white as a sheet thinking of the harm he had led us to the good soul And one of the six forecastle hands was little better
Theres a man says Captain Smollett nodding towards him new to this work He came nigh-hand fainting doctor when he heard the cry Another touch of the rudder and that man would join us
I told my plan to the captain and between us we settled on the details of its accomplishment
We put old Redruth in the gallery between the cabin and the forecastle with three or four loaded muskets and a mattress for protection Hunter brought the boat round under the stern-port and Joyce and I set to work loading her with powder tins muskets bags of biscuits kegs of pork a cask of cognac and my invaluable medicine chest
In the meantime the squire and the captain stayed on deck and the latter hailed the coxswain who was the principal man aboard
Mr Hands he said here are two of us with a brace of pistols each If any one of you six make a signal of any description that mans dead
They were a good deal taken aback and after a little consultation one and all tumbled down the fore companion thinking no doubt to take us on the rear But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley they went about ship at once and a head popped out again on deck
Down dog cries the captain
And the head popped back again and we heard no more for the time of these six very faint-hearted seamen
By this time tumbling things in as they came we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared Joyce and I got out through the stern-port and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us
This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore Lillibullero was dropped again and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point one of them whipped ashore and disappeared I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand and all might very well be lost by trying for too much
We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house All three made the first journey heavily laden and tossed our stores over the palisade Then leaving Joyce to guard themone man to be sure but with half a dozen musketsHunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more So we proceeded without pausing to take breath till the whole cargo was bestowed when the two servants took up their position in the block house and I with all my power sculled back to the HISPANIOLA
That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was They had the advantage of numbers of course but we had the advantage of arms Not one of the men ashore had a musket and before they could get within range for pistol shooting we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least
The squire was waiting for me at the stern window all his faintness gone from him He caught the painter and made it fast and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives Pork powder and biscuit was the cargo with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun on the clean sandy bottom
By this time the tide was beginning to ebb and the ship was swinging round to her anchor Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter who were well to the eastward it warned our party to be off
Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat which we then brought round to the ships counter to be handier for Captain Smollett
Now men said he do you hear me
There was no answer from the forecastle
Its to you Abraham Grayits to you I am speaking
Still no reply
Gray resumed Mr Smollett a little louder I am leaving this ship and I order you to follow your captain I know you are a good man at bottom and I dare say not one of the lot of yous as bad as he makes out I have my watch here in my hand I give you thirty seconds to join me in
There was a pause
Come my fine fellow continued the captain dont hang so long in stays Im risking my life and the lives of these good gentlemen every second
There was a sudden scuffle a sound of blows and out burst Abraham Gray with a knife cut on the side of the cheek and came running to the captain like a dog to the whistle
Im with you sir said he
And the next moment he and the captain had dropped aboard of us and we had shoved off and given way
We were clear out of the ship but not yet ashore in our stockade
Narrative Continued by the Doctor The Jolly-boats Last Trip
THIS fifth trip was quite different from any of the others In the first place the little gallipot of a boat that we were in was gravely overloaded Five grown men and three of themTrelawney Redruth and the captainover six feet high was already more than she was meant to carry Add to that the powder pork and bread-bags The gunwale was lipping astern Several times we shipped a little water and my breeches and the tails of my coat were all soaking wet before we had gone a hundred yards
The captain made us trim the boat and we got her to lie a little more evenly All the same we were afraid to breathe
In the second place the ebb was now makinga strong rippling current running westward through the basin and then southard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs where the pirates might appear at any moment
I cannot keep her head for the stockade sir said I to the captain I was steering while he and Redruth two fresh men were at the oars The tide keeps washing her down Could you pull a little stronger
Not without swamping the boat said he You must bear up sir if you pleasebear up until you see youre gaining
I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east or just about right angles to the way we ought to go
Well never get ashore at this rate said I
If its the only course that we can lie sir we must even lie it returned the captain We must keep upstream You see sir he went on if once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place its hard to say where we should get ashore besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs whereas the way we go the current must slacken and then we can dodge back along the shore
The currents less aready sir said the man Gray who was sitting in the fore-sheets you can ease her off a bit
Thank you my man said I quite as if nothing had happened for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves
Suddenly the captain spoke up again and I thought his voice was a little changed
The gun said he
I have thought of that said I for I made sure he was thinking of a bombardment of the fort They could never get the gun ashore and if they did they could never haul it through the woods
Look astern doctor replied the captain
We had entirely forgotten the long nine and there to our horror were the five rogues busy about her getting off her jacket as they called the stout tarpaulin cover under which she sailed Not only that but it flashed into my mind at the same moment that the round-shot and the powder for the gun had been left behind and a stroke with an axe would put it all into the possession of the evil ones abroad
Israel was Flints gunner said Gray hoarsely
At any risk we put the boats head direct for the landing-place By this time we had got so far out of the run of the current that we kept steerage way even at our necessarily gentle rate of rowing and I could keep her steady for the goal But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door
I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck
Whos the best shot asked the captain
Mr Trelawney out and away said I
Mr Trelawney will you please pick me off one of these men sir Hands if possible said the captain
Trelawney was as cool as steel He looked to the priming of his gun
Now cried the captain easy with that gun sir or youll swamp the boat All hands stand by to trim her when he aims
The squire raised his gun the rowing ceased and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop
They had the gun by this time slewed round upon the swivel and Hands who was at the muzzle with the rammer was in consequence the most exposed However we had no luck for just as Trelawney fired down he stooped the ball whistled over him and it was one of the other four who fell
The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats
Here come the gigs sir said I
Give way then cried the captain We mustnt mind if we swamp her now If we cant get ashore alls up
Only one of the gigs is being manned sir I added the crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off
Theyll have a hot run sir returned the captain Jack ashore you know Its not them I mind its the round-shot Carpet bowls My ladys maid couldnt miss Tell us squire when you see the match and well hold water
In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded and we had shipped but little water in the process We were now close in thirty or forty strokes and we should beach her for the ebb had already disclosed a narrow belt of sand below the clustering trees The gig was no longer to be feared the little point had already concealed it from our eyes The ebb-tide which had so cruelly delayed us was now making reparation and delaying our assailants The one source of danger was the gun
If I durst said the captain Id stop and pick off another man
But it was plain that they meant nothing should delay their shot They had never so much as looked at their fallen comrade though he was not dead and I could see him trying to crawl away
Ready cried the squire
Hold cried the captain quick as an echo
And he and Redruth backed with a great heave that sent her stern bodily under water The report fell in at the same instant of time This was the first that Jim heard the sound of the squires shot not having reached him Where the ball passed not one of us precisely knew but I fancy it must have been over our heads and that the wind of it may have contributed to our disaster
At any rate the boat sank by the stern quite gently in three feet of water leaving the captain and myself facing each other on our feet The other three took complete headers and came up again drenched and bubbling
So far there was no great harm No lives were lost and we could wade ashore in safety But there were all our stores at the bottom and to make things worse only two guns out of five remained in a state for service Mine I had snatched from my knees and held over my head by a sort of instinct As for the captain he had carried his over his shoulder by a bandoleer and like a wise man lock uppermost The other three had gone down with the boat
To add to our concern we heard voices already drawing near us in the woods along shore and we had not only the danger of being cut off from the stockade in our half-crippled state but the fear before us whether if Hunter and Joyce were attacked by half a dozen they would have the sense and conduct to stand firm Hunter was steady that we knew Joyce was a doubtful casea pleasant polite man for a valet and to brush ones clothes but not entirely fitted for a man of war
With all this in our minds we waded ashore as fast as we could leaving behind us the poor jolly-boat and a good half of all our powder and provisions
Narrative Continued by the Doctor End of the First Days Fighting
WE made our best speed across the strip of wood that now divided us from the stockade and at every step we took the voices of the buccaneers rang nearer Soon we could hear their footfalls as they ran and the cracking of the branches as they breasted across a bit of thicket
I began to see we should have a brush for it in earnest and looked to my priming
Captain said I Trelawney is the dead shot Give him your gun his own is useless
They exchanged guns and Trelawney silent and cool as he had been since the beginning of the bustle hung a moment on his heel to see that all was fit for service At the same time observing Gray to be unarmed I handed him my cutlass It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand knit his brows and make the blade sing through the air It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt
Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side and almost at the same time seven mutineersJob Anderson the boatswain at their headappeared in full cry at the southwestern corner
They paused as if taken aback and before they recovered not only the squire and I but Hunter and Joyce from the block house had time to fire The four shots came in rather a scattering volley but they did the business one of the enemy actually fell and the rest without hesitation turned and plunged into the trees
After reloading we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy He was stone deadshot through the heart
We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush a ball whistled close past my ear and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground Both the squire and I returned the shot but as we had nothing to aim at it is probable we only wasted powder Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom
The captain and Gray were already examining him and I saw with half an eye that all was over
I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried groaning and bleeding into the log-house
Poor old fellow he had not uttered one word of surprise complaint fear or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now when we had laid him down in the log-house to die He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery he had followed every order silently doggedly and well he was the oldest of our party by a score of years and now sullen old serviceable servant it was he that was to die
The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand crying like a child
Be I going doctor he asked
Tom my man said I youre going home
I wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first he replied
Tom said the squire say you forgive me wont you
Would that be respectful like from me to you squire was the answer Howsoever so be it amen
After a little while of silence he said he thought somebody might read a prayer Its the custom sir he added apologetically And not long after without another word he passed away
In the meantime the captain whom I had observed to be wonderfully swollen about the chest and pockets had turned out a great many various storesthe British colours a Bible a coil of stoutish rope pen ink the log-book and pounds of tobacco He had found a longish fir-tree lying felled and trimmed in the enclosure and with the help of Hunter he had set it up at the corner of the log-house where the trunks crossed and made an angle Then climbing on the roof he had with his own hand bent and run up the colours
This seemed mightily to relieve him He re-entered the log-house and set about counting up the stores as if nothing else existed But he had an eye on Toms passage for all that and as soon as all was over came forward with another flag and reverently spread it on the body
Dont you take on sir he said shaking the squires hand Alls well with him no fear for a hand thats been shot down in his duty to captain and owner It maynt be good divinity but its a fact
Then he pulled me aside
Dr Livesey he said in how many weeks do you and squire expect the consort
I told him it was a question not of weeks but of months that if we were not back by the end of August Blandly was to send to find us but neither sooner nor later You can calculate for yourself I said
Why yes returned the captain scratching his head and making a large allowance sir for all the gifts of Providence I should say we were pretty close hauled
How do you mean I asked
Its a pity sir we lost that second load Thats what I mean replied the captain As for powder and shot well do But the rations are short very shortso short Dr Livesey that were perhaps as well without that extra mouth
And he pointed to the dead body under the flag
Just then with a roar and a whistle a round-shot passed high above the roof of the log-house and plumped far beyond us in the wood
Oho said the captain Blaze away Youve little enough powder already my lads
At the second trial the aim was better and the ball descended inside the stockade scattering a cloud of sand but doing no further damage
Captain said the squire the house is quite invisible from the ship It must be the flag they are aiming at Would it not be wiser to take it in
Strike my colours cried the captain No sir not I and as soon as he had said the words I think we all agreed with him For it was not only a piece of stout seamanly good feeling it was good policy besides and showed our enemies that we despised their cannonade
All through the evening they kept thundering away Ball after ball flew over or fell short or kicked up the sand in the enclosure but they had to fire so high that the shot fell dead and buried itself in the soft sand We had no ricochet to fear and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket
There is one good thing about all this observed the captain the wood in front of us is likely clear The ebb has made a good while our stores should be uncovered Volunteers to go and bring in pork
Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward Well armed they stole out of the stockade but it proved a useless mission The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israels gunnery For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current Silver was in the stern-sheets in command and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own
The captain sat down to his log and here is the beginning of the entry
And at the same time I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins fate
A hail on the land side
Somebody hailing us said Hunter who was on guard
Doctor Squire Captain Hullo Hunter is that you came the cries
And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins safe and sound come climbing over the stockade
Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins The Garrison in the Stockade
AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt stopped me by the arm and sat down
Now said he theres your friends sure enough
Far more likely its the mutineers I answered
That he cried Why in a place like this where nobody puts in but genlemen of fortune Silver would fly the Jolly Roger you dont make no doubt of that No thats your friends Theres been blows too and I reckon your friends has had the best of it and here they are ashore in the old stockade as was made years and years ago by Flint Ah he was the man to have a headpiece was Flint Barring rum his match were never seen He were afraid of none not he ony SilverSilver was that genteel
Well said I that may be so and so be it all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends
Nay mate returned Ben not you Youre a good boy or Im mistook but youre ony a boy all told Now Ben Gunn is fly Rum wouldnt bring me there where youre goingnot rum wouldnt till I see your born genleman and gets it on his word of honour And you wont forget my words A precious sight thats what youll say a precious sight more confidenceand then nips him
And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness
And when Ben Gunn is wanted you know where to find him Jim Just wheer you found him today And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand and hes to come alone Oh And youll say this Ben Gunn says you has reasons of his own
Well said I I believe I understand You have something to propose and you wish to see the squire or the doctor and youre to be found where I found you Is that all
And when says you he added Why from about noon observation to about six bells
Good said I and now may I go
You wont forget he inquired anxiously Precious sight and reasons of his own says you Reasons of his own thats the mainstay as between man and man Well thenstill holding meI reckon you can go Jim And Jim if you was to see Silver you wouldnt go for to sell Ben Gunn Wild horses wouldnt draw it from you No says you And if them pirates camp ashore Jim what would you say but thered be widders in the morning
Here he was interrupted by a loud report and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction
For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island and balls kept crashing through the woods I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place always pursued or so it seemed to me by these terrifying missiles But towards the end of the bombardment though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade where the balls fell oftenest I had begun in a manner to pluck up my heart again and after a long detour to the east crept down among the shore-side trees
The sun had just set the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage the tide too was far out and great tracts of sand lay uncovered the air after the heat of the day chilled me through my jacket
The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored but sure enough there was the Jolly Rogerthe black flag of piracyflying from her peak Even as I looked there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering and one more round-shot whistled through the air It was the last of the cannonade
I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockadethe poor jolly-boat I afterwards discovered Away near the mouth of the river a great fire was glowing among the trees and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going the men whom I had seen so gloomy shouting at the oars like children But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum
At length I thought I might return towards the stockade I was pretty far down on the low sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island and now as I rose to my feet I saw some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes an isolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in colour It occurred to me that this might be the white rock of which Ben Gunn had spoken and that some day or other a boat might be wanted and I should know where to look for one
Then I skirted among the woods until I had regained the rear or shoreward side of the stockade and was soon warmly welcomed by the faithful party
I had soon told my story and began to look about me The log-house was made of unsquared trunks of pineroof walls and floor The latter stood in several places as much as a foot or a foot and a half above the surface of the sand There was a porch at the door and under this porch the little spring welled up into an artificial basin of a rather odd kindno other than a great ships kettle of iron with the bottom knocked out and sunk to her bearings as the captain said among the sand
Little had been left besides the framework of the house but in one corner there was a stone slab laid down by way of hearth and an old rusty iron basket to contain the fire
The slopes of the knoll and all the inside of the stockade had been cleared of timber to build the house and we could see by the stumps what a fine and lofty grove had been destroyed Most of the soil had been washed away or buried in drift after the removal of the trees only where the streamlet ran down from the kettle a thick bed of moss and some ferns and little creeping bushes were still green among the sand Very close around the stockadetoo close for defence they saidthe wood still flourished high and dense all of fir on the land side but towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks
The cold evening breeze of which I have spoken whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand There was sand in our eyes sand in our teeth sand in our suppers sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle for all the world like porridge beginning to boil Our chimney was a square hole in the roof it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye
Add to this that Gray the new man had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth still unburied lay along the wall stiff and stark under the Union Jack
If we had been allowed to sit idle we should all have fallen in the blues but Captain Smollett was never the man for that All hands were called up before him and he divided us into watches The doctor and Gray and I for one the squire Hunter and Joyce upon the other Tired though we all were two were sent out for firewood two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth the doctor was named cook I was put sentry at the door and the captain himself went from one to another keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted
From time to time the doctor came to the door for a little air and to rest his eyes which were almost smoked out of his head and whenever he did so he had a word for me
That man Smollett he said once is a better man than I am And when I say that it means a deal Jim
Another time he came and was silent for a while Then he put his head on one side and looked at me
Is this Ben Gunn a man he asked
I do not know sir said I I am not very sure whether hes sane
If theres any doubt about the matter he is returned the doctor A man who has been three years biting his nails on a desert island Jim cant expect to appear as sane as you or me It doesnt lie in human nature Was it cheese you said he had a fancy for
Yes sir cheese I answered
Well Jim says he just see the good that comes of being dainty in your food Youve seen my snuff-box havent you And you never saw me take snuff the reason being that in my snuff-box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheesea cheese made in Italy very nutritious Well thats for Ben Gunn
Before supper was eaten we buried old Tom in the sand and stood round him for a while bare-headed in the breeze A good deal of firewood had been got in but not enough for the captains fancy and he shook his head over it and told us we must get back to this tomorrow rather livelier Then when we had eaten our pork and each had a good stiff glass of brandy grog the three chiefs got together in a corner to discuss our prospects
It appears they were at their wits end what to do the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came But our best hope it was decided was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen two others were wounded and one at leastthe man shot beside the gunseverely wounded if he were not dead Every time we had a crack at them we were to take it saving our own lives with the extremest care And besides that we had two able alliesrum and the climate
As for the first though we were about half a mile away we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night and as for the second the doctor staked his wig that camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies the half of them would be on their backs before a week
So he added if we are not all shot down first theyll be glad to be packing in the schooner Its always a ship and they can get to buccaneering again I suppose
First ship that ever I lost said Captain Smollett
I was dead tired as you may fancy and when I got to sleep which was not till after a great deal of tossing I slept like a log of wood
The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices
Flag of truce I heard someone say and then immediately after with a cry of surprise Silver himself
And at that up I jumped and rubbing my eyes ran to a loophole in the wall
Silvers Embassy
SURE enough there were two men just outside the stockade one of them waving a white cloth the other no less a person than Silver himself standing placidly by
It was still quite early and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad ina chill that pierced into the marrow The sky was bright and cloudless overhead and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun But where Silver stood with his lieutenant all was still in shadow and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island It was plainly a damp feverish unhealthy spot
Keep indoors men said the captain Ten to one this is a trick
Then he hailed the buccaneer
Who goes Stand or we fire
Flag of truce cried Silver
The captain was in the porch keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot should any be intended He turned and spoke to us Doctors watch on the lookout Dr Livesey take the north side if you please Jim the east Gray west The watch below all hands to load muskets Lively men and careful
And then he turned again to the mutineers
And what do you want with your flag of truce he cried
This time it was the other man who replied
Capn Silver sir to come on board and make terms he shouted
Capn Silver Dont know him Whos he cried the captain And we could hear him adding to himself Capn is it My heart and heres promotion
Long John answered for himself Me sir These poor lads have chosen me capn after your desertion sirlaying a particular emphasis upon the word desertion Were willing to submit if we can come to terms and no bones about it All I ask is your word Capn Smollett to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade and one minute to get out o shot before a gun is fired
My man said Captain Smollett I have not the slightest desire to talk to you If you wish to talk to me you can come thats all If theres any treachery itll be on your side and the Lord help you
Thats enough capn shouted Long John cheerily A word from yous enough I know a gentleman and you may lay to that
We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back Nor was that wonderful seeing how cavalier had been the captains answer But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd Then he advanced to the stockade threw over his crutch got a leg up and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side
I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry indeed I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain who had now seated himself on the threshold with his elbows on his knees his head in his hands and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand He was whistling Come Lasses and Lads
Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll What with the steepness of the incline the thick tree stumps and the soft sand he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays But he stuck to it like a man in silence and at last arrived before the captain whom he saluted in the handsomest style He was tricked out in his best an immense blue coat thick with brass buttons hung as low as to his knees and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head
Here you are my man said the captain raising his head You had better sit down
You aint a-going to let me inside capn complained Long John Its a main cold morning to be sure sir to sit outside upon the sand
Why Silver said the captain if you had pleased to be an honest man you might have been sitting in your galley Its your own doing Youre either my ships cookand then you were treated handsomeor Capn Silver a common mutineer and pirate and then you can go hang
Well well capn returned the sea-cook sitting down as he was bidden on the sand youll have to give me a hand up again thats all A sweet pretty place you have of it here Ah theres Jim The top of the morning to you Jim Doctor heres my service Why there you all are together like a happy family in a manner of speaking
If you have anything to say my man better say it said the captain
Right you were Capn Smollett replied Silver Dooty is dooty to be sure Well now you look here that was a good lay of yours last night I dont deny it was a good lay Some of you pretty handy with a handspike-end And Ill not deny neither but what some of my people was shookmaybe all was shook maybe I was shook myself maybe thats why Im here for terms But you mark me capn it wont do twice by thunder Well have to do sentry-go and ease off a point or so on the rum Maybe you think we were all a sheet in the winds eye But Ill tell you I was sober I was ony dog tired and if Id awoke a second sooner Id a caught you at the act I would He wasnt dead when I got round to him not he
Well says Captain Smollett as cool as can be
All that Silver said was a riddle to him but you would never have guessed it from his tone As for me I began to have an inkling Ben Gunns last words came back to my mind I began to suppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunk together round their fire and I reckoned up with glee that we had only fourteen enemies to deal with
Well here it is said Silver We want that treasure and well have itthats our point You would just as soon save your lives I reckon and thats yours You have a chart havent you
Thats as may be replied the captain
Oh well you have I know that returned Long John You neednt be so husky with a man there aint a particle of service in that and you may lay to it What I mean is we want your chart Now I never meant you no harm myself
That wont do with me my man interrupted the captain We know exactly what you meant to do and we dont care for now you see you cant do it
And the captain looked at him calmly and proceeded to fill a pipe
If Abe Gray Silver broke out
Avast there cried Mr Smollett Gray told me nothing and I asked him nothing and whats more I would see you and him and this whole island blown clean out of the water into blazes first So theres my mind for you my man on that
This little whiff of temper seemed to cool Silver down He had been growing nettled before but now he pulled himself together
Like enough said he I would set no limits to what gentlemen might consider shipshape or might not as the case were And seein as how you are about to take a pipe capn Ill make so free as do likewise
And he filled a pipe and lighted it and the two men sat silently smoking for quite a while now looking each other in the face now stopping their tobacco now leaning forward to spit It was as good as the play to see them
Now resumed Silver here it is You give us the chart to get the treasure by and drop shooting poor seamen and stoving of their heads in while asleep You do that and well offer you a choice Either you come aboard along of us once the treasure shipped and then Ill give you my affy-davy upon my word of honour to clap you somewhere safe ashore Or if that aint to your fancy some of my hands being rough and having old scores on account of hazing then you can stay here you can Well divide stores with you man for man and Ill give my affy-davy as before to speak the first ship I sight and send em here to pick you up Now youll own thats talking Handsomer you couldnt look to get now you And I hoperaising his voicethat all hands in this here block house will overhaul my words for what is spoke to one is spoke to all
Captain Smollett rose from his seat and knocked out the ashes of his pipe in the palm of his left hand
Is that all he asked
Every last word by thunder answered John Refuse that and youve seen the last of me but musket-balls
Very good said the captain Now youll hear me If youll come up one by one unarmed Ill engage to clap you all in irons and take you home to a fair trial in England If you wont my name is Alexander Smollett Ive flown my sovereigns colours and Ill see you all to Davy Jones You cant find the treasure You cant sail the shiptheres not a man among you fit to sail the ship You cant fight usGray there got away from five of you Your ships in irons Master Silver youre on a lee shore and so youll find I stand here and tell you so and theyre the last good words youll get from me for in the name of heaven Ill put a bullet in your back when next I meet you Tramp my lad Bundle out of this please hand over hand and double quick
Silvers face was a picture his eyes started in his head with wrath He shook the fire out of his pipe
Give me a hand up he cried
Not I returned the captain
Wholl give me a hand up he roared
Not a man among us moved Growling the foulest imprecations he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch Then he spat into the spring
There he cried Thats what I think of ye Before an hours out Ill stove in your old block house like a rum puncheon Laugh by thunder laugh Before an hours out yell laugh upon the other side Them that diell be the lucky ones
And with a dreadful oath he stumbled off ploughed down the sand was helped across the stockade after four or five failures by the man with the flag of truce and disappeared in an instant afterwards among the trees
The Attack
AS soon as Silver disappeared the captain who had been closely watching him turned towards the interior of the house and found not a man of us at his post but Gray It was the first time we had ever seen him angry
Quarters he roared And then as we all slunk back to our places Gray he said Ill put your name in the log youve stood by your duty like a seaman Mr Trelawney Im surprised at you sir Doctor I thought you had worn the kings coat If that was how you served at Fontenoy sir youd have been better in your berth
The doctors watch were all back at their loopholes the rest were busy loading the spare muskets and everyone with a red face you may be certain and a flea in his ear as the saying is
The captain looked on for a while in silence Then he spoke
My lads said he Ive given Silver a broadside I pitched it in red-hot on purpose and before the hours out as he said we shall be boarded Were outnumbered I neednt tell you that but we fight in shelter and a minute ago I should have said we fought with discipline Ive no manner of doubt that we can drub them if you choose
Then he went the rounds and saw as he said that all was clear
On the two short sides of the house east and west there were only two loopholes on the south side where the porch was two again and on the north side five There was a round score of muskets for the seven of us the firewood had been built into four pilestables you might sayone about the middle of each side and on each of these tables some ammunition and four loaded muskets were laid ready to the hand of the defenders In the middle the cutlasses lay ranged
Toss out the fire said the captain the chill is past and we mustnt have smoke in our eyes
The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr Trelawney and the embers smothered among sand
Hawkins hasnt had his breakfast Hawkins help yourself and back to your post to eat it continued Captain Smollett Lively now my lad youll want it before youve done Hunter serve out a round of brandy to all hands
And while this was going on the captain completed in his own mind the plan of the defence
Doctor you will take the door he resumed See and dont expose yourself keep within and fire through the porch Hunter take the east side there Joyce you stand by the west my man Mr Trelawney you are the best shotyou and Gray will take this long north side with the five loopholes its there the danger is If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports things would begin to look dirty Hawkins neither you nor I are much account at the shooting well stand by to load and bear a hand
As the captain had said the chill was past As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house Jackets and coats were flung aside shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders and we stood there each at his post in a fever of heat and anxiety
An hour passed away
Hang them said the captain This is as dull as the doldrums Gray whistle for a wind
And just at that moment came the first news of the attack
If you please sir said Joyce if I see anyone am I to fire
I told you so cried the captain
Thank you sir returned Joyce with the same quiet civility
Nothing followed for a time but the remark had set us all on the alert straining ears and eyesthe musketeers with their pieces balanced in their hands the captain out in the middle of the block house with his mouth very tight and a frown on his face
So some seconds passed till suddenly Joyce whipped up his musket and fired The report had scarcely died away ere it was repeated and repeated from without in a scattering volley shot behind shot like a string of geese from every side of the enclosure Several bullets struck the log-house but not one entered and as the smoke cleared away and vanished the stockade and the woods around it looked as quiet and empty as before Not a bough waved not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes
Did you hit your man asked the captain
No sir replied Joyce I believe not sir
Next best thing to tell the truth muttered Captain Smollett Load his gun Hawkins How many should say there were on your side doctor
I know precisely said Dr Livesey Three shots were fired on this side I saw the three flashestwo close togetherone farther to the west
Three repeated the captain And how many on yours Mr Trelawney
But this was not so easily answered There had come many from the northseven by the squires computation eight or nine according to Gray From the east and west only a single shot had been fired It was plain therefore that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade he argued they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold
Nor had we much time left to us for thought Suddenly with a loud huzza a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade At the same moment the fire was once more opened from the woods and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctors musket into bits
The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys Squire and Gray fired again and yet again three men fell one forwards into the enclosure two back on the outside But of these one was evidently more frightened than hurt for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees
Two had bit the dust one had fled four had made good their footing inside our defences while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men each evidently supplied with several muskets kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house
The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building shouting as they ran and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them Several shots were fired but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect In a moment the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us
The head of Job Anderson the boatswain appeared at the middle loophole
At em all handsall hands he roared in a voice of thunder
At the same moment another pirate grasped Hunters musket by the muzzle wrenched it from his hands plucked it through the loophole and with one stunning blow laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor Meanwhile a third running unharmed all around the house appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor
Our position was utterly reversed A moment since we were firing under cover at an exposed enemy now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow
The log-house was full of smoke to which we owed our comparative safety Cries and confusion the flashes and reports of pistol-shots and one loud groan rang in my ears
Out lads out and fight em in the open Cutlasses cried the captain
I snatched a cutlass from the pile and someone at the same time snatching another gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight Someone was close behind I knew not whom Right in front the doctor was pursuing his assailant down the hill and just as my eyes fell upon him beat down his guard and sent him sprawling on his back with a great slash across the face
Round the house lads Round the house cried the captain and even in the hurly-burly I perceived a change in his voice
Mechanically I obeyed turned eastwards and with my cutlass raised ran round the corner of the house Next moment I was face to face with Anderson He roared aloud and his hanger went up above his head flashing in the sunlight I had not time to be afraid but as the blow still hung impending leaped in a trice upon one side and missing my foot in the soft sand rolled headlong down the slope
When I had first sallied from the door the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us One man in a red night-cap with his cutlass in his mouth had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across Well so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade And yet in this breath of time the fight was over and the victory was ours
Gray following close behind me had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony the pistol still smoking in his hand A third as I had seen the doctor had disposed of at a blow Of the four who had scaled the palisade one only remained unaccounted for and he having left his cutlass on the field was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him
Firefire from the house cried the doctor And you lads back into cover
But his words were unheeded no shot was fired and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade
The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets and at any moment the fire might recommence
The house was by this time somewhat cleared of smoke and we saw at a glance the price we had paid for victory Hunter lay beside his loophole stunned Joyce by his shot through the head never to move again while right in the centre the squire was supporting the captain one as pale as the other
The captains wounded said Mr Trelawney
Have they run asked Mr Smollett
All that could you may be bound returned the doctor but theres five of them will never run again
Five cried the captain Come thats better Five against three leaves us four to nine Thats better odds than we had at starting We were seven to nineteen then or thought we were and thats as bad to bear
The mutineers were soon only eight in number for the man shot by Mr Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound But this was of course not known till after by the faithful party
PART FIVE My Sea Adventure
How My Sea Adventure Began
THERE was no return of the mutineersnot so much as another shot out of the woods They had got their rations for that day as the captain put it and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctors patients
Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action only three still breathedthat one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole Hunter and Captain Smollett and of these the first two were as good as dead the mutineer indeed died under the doctors knife and Hunter do what we could never recovered consciousness in this world He lingered all day breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling and some time in the following night without sign or sound he went to his Maker
As for the captain his wounds were grievous indeed but not dangerous No organ was fatally injured Andersons ballfor it was Job that shot him firsthad broken his shoulder-blade and touched the lung not badly the second had only torn and displaced some muscles in the calf He was sure to recover the doctor said but in the meantime and for weeks to come he must not walk nor move his arm nor so much as speak when he could help it
My own accidental cut across the knuckles was a flea-bite Doctor Livesey patched it up with plaster and pulled my ears for me into the bargain
After dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captains side awhile in consultation and when they had talked to their hearts content it being then a little past noon the doctor took up his hat and pistols girt on a cutlass put the chart in his pocket and with a musket over his shoulder crossed the palisade on the north side and set off briskly through the trees
Gray and I were sitting together at the far end of the block house to be out of earshot of our officers consulting and Gray took his pipe out of his mouth and fairly forgot to put it back again so thunder-struck he was at this occurrence
Why in the name of Davy Jones said he is Dr Livesey mad
Why no says I Hes about the last of this crew for that I take it
Well shipmate said Gray mad he may not be but if HES not you mark my words I am
I take it replied I the doctor has his idea and if I am right hes going now to see Ben Gunn
I was right as appeared later but in the meantime the house being stifling hot and the little patch of sand inside the palisade ablaze with midday sun I began to get another thought into my head which was not by any means so right What I began to do was to envy the doctor walking in the cool shadow of the woods with the birds about him and the pleasant smell of the pines while I sat grilling with my clothes stuck to the hot resin and so much blood about me and so many poor dead bodies lying all around that I took a disgust of the place that was almost as strong as fear
All the time I was washing out the block house and then washing up the things from dinner this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger till at last being near a bread-bag and no one then observing me I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit
I was a fool if you like and certainly I was going to do a foolish over-bold act but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power These biscuits should anything befall me would keep me at least from starving till far on in the next day
The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols and as I already had a powder-horn and bullets I felt myself well supplied with arms
As for the scheme I had in my head it was not a bad one in itself I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea find the white rock I had observed last evening and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat a thing quite worth doing as I still believe But as I was certain I should not be allowed to leave the enclosure my only plan was to take French leave and slip out when nobody was watching and that was so bad a way of doing it as made the thing itself wrong But I was only a boy and I had made my mind up
Well as things at last fell out I found an admirable opportunity The squire and Gray were busy helping the captain with his bandages the coast was clear I made a bolt for it over the stockade and into the thickest of the trees and before my absence was observed I was out of cry of my companions
This was my second folly far worse than the first as I left but two sound men to guard the house but like the first it was a help towards saving all of us
I took my way straight for the east coast of the island for I was determined to go down the sea side of the spit to avoid all chance of observation from the anchorage It was already late in the afternoon although still warm and sunny As I continued to thread the tall woods I could hear from far before me not only the continuous thunder of the surf but a certain tossing of foliage and grinding of boughs which showed me the sea breeze had set in higher than usual Soon cool draughts of air began to reach me and a few steps farther I came forth into the open borders of the grove and saw the sea lying blue and sunny to the horizon and the surf tumbling and tossing its foam along the beach
I have never seen the sea quiet round Treasure Island The sun might blaze overhead the air be without a breath the surface smooth and blue but still these great rollers would be running along all the external coast thundering and thundering by day and night and I scarce believe there is one spot in the island where a man would be out of earshot of their noise
I walked along beside the surf with great enjoyment till thinking I was now got far enough to the south I took the cover of some thick bushes and crept warily up to the ridge of the spit
Behind me was the sea in front the anchorage The sea breeze as though it had the sooner blown itself out by its unusual violence was already at an end it had been succeeded by light variable airs from the south and south-east carrying great banks of fog and the anchorage under lee of Skeleton Island lay still and leaden as when first we entered it The HISPANIOLA in that unbroken mirror was exactly portrayed from the truck to the waterline the Jolly Roger hanging from her peak
Alongside lay one of the gigs Silver in the stern-sheetshim I could always recognizewhile a couple of men were leaning over the stern bulwarks one of them with a red capthe very rogue that I had seen some hours before stride-legs upon the palisade Apparently they were talking and laughing though at that distanceupwards of a mileI could of course hear no word of what was said All at once there began the most horrid unearthly screaming which at first startled me badly though I had soon remembered the voice of Captain Flint and even thought I could make out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her masters wrist
Soon after the jolly-boat shoved off and pulled for shore and the man with the red cap and his comrade went below by the cabin companion
Just about the same time the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass and as the fog was collecting rapidly it began to grow dark in earnest I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening
The white rock visible enough above the brush was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit and it took me a goodish while to get up with it crawling often on all fours among the scrub Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep that grew there very plentifully and in the centre of the dell sure enough a little tent of goat-skins like what the gipsies carry about with them in England
I dropped into the hollow lifted the side of the tent and there was Ben Gunns boathome-made if ever anything was home-made a rude lop-sided framework of tough wood and stretched upon that a covering of goat-skin with the hair inside The thing was extremely small even for me and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man There was one thwart set as low as possible a kind of stretcher in the bows and a double paddle for propulsion
I had not then seen a coracle such as the ancient Britons made but I have seen one since and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunns boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed for it was exceedingly light and portable
Well now that I had found the boat you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out I believe in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself This was to slip out under cover of the night cut the HISPANIOLA adrift and let her go ashore where she fancied I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers after their repulse of the morning had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea this I thought it would be a fine thing to prevent and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat I thought it might be done with little risk
Down I sat to wait for darkness and made a hearty meal of biscuit It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose The fog had now buried all heaven As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island And when at last I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage
One was the great fire on shore by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp The other a mere blur of light upon the darkness indicated the position of the anchored ship She had swung round to the ebbher bow was now towards methe only lights on board were in the cabin and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window
The ebb had already run some time and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand where I sank several times above the ankle before I came to the edge of the retreating water and wading a little way in with some strength and dexterity set my coracle keel downwards on the surface
The Ebb-tide Runs
THE coracleas I had ample reason to know before I was done with herwas a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight both buoyant and clever in a seaway but she was the most cross-grained lop-sided craft to manage Do as you pleased she always made more leeway than anything else and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was queer to handle till you knew her way
Certainly I did not know her way She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go the most part of the time we were broadside on and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide By good fortune paddle as I pleased the tide was still sweeping me down and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway hardly to be missed
First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness then her spars and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seemed for the farther I went the brisker grew the current of the ebb I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold
The hawser was as taut as a bowstring and the current so strong she pulled upon her anchor All round the hull in the blackness the rippling current bubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream One cut with my sea-gully and the HISPANIOLA would go humming down the tide
So far so good but it next occurred to my recollection that a taut hawser suddenly cut is a thing as dangerous as a kicking horse Ten to one if I were so foolhardy as to cut the HISPANIOLA from her anchor I and the coracle would be knocked clean out of the water
This brought me to a full stop and if fortune had not again particularly favoured me I should have had to abandon my design But the light airs which had begun blowing from the south-east and south had hauled round after nightfall into the south-west Just while I was meditating a puff came caught the HISPANIOLA and forced her up into the current and to my great joy I felt the hawser slacken in my grasp and the hand by which I held it dip for a second under water
With that I made my mind up took out my gully opened it with my teeth and cut one strand after another till the vessel swung only by two Then I lay quiet waiting to sever these last when the strain should be once more lightened by a breath of wind
All this time I had heard the sound of loud voices from the cabin but to say truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughts that I had scarcely given ear Now however when I had nothing else to do I began to pay more heed
One I recognized for the coxswains Israel Hands that had been Flints gunner in former days The other was of course my friend of the red night-cap Both men were plainly the worse of drink and they were still drinking for even while I was listening one of them with a drunken cry opened the stern window and threw out something which I divined to be an empty bottle But they were not only tipsy it was plain that they were furiously angry Oaths flew like hailstones and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result
On shore I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees Someone was singing a dull old droning sailors song with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words
And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning But indeed from what I saw all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on
At last the breeze came the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark I felt the hawser slacken once more and with a good tough effort cut the last fibres through
The breeze had but little action on the coracle and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA At the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heel spinning slowly end for end across the current
I wrought like a fiend for I expected every moment to be swamped and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off I now shoved straight astern At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour and just as I gave the last impulsion my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks Instantly I grasped it
Why I should have done so I can hardly say It was at first mere instinct but once I had it in my hands and found it fast curiosity began to get the upper hand and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window
I pulled in hand over hand on the cord and when I judged myself near enough rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin
By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water indeed we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire The ship was talking as sailors say loudly treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm One glance however was sufficient and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle each with a hand upon the others throat
I dropped upon the thwart again none too soon for I was near overboard I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness
The endless ballad had come to an end at last and the whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so often
I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA when I was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle At the same moment she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course The speed in the meantime had strangely increased
I opened my eyes at once All round me were little ripples combing over with a sharp bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent The HISPANIOLA herself a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along seemed to stagger in her course and I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night nay as I looked longer I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward
I glanced over my shoulder and my heart jumped against my ribs There right behind me was the glow of the camp-fire The current had turned at right angles sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle ever quickening ever bubbling higher ever muttering louder it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea
Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw turning perhaps through twenty degrees and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board I could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster
I lay down flat in the bottom of that wretched skiff and devoutly recommended my spirit to its Maker At the end of the straits I made sure we must fall into some bar of raging breakers where all my troubles would be ended speedily and though I could perhaps bear to die I could not bear to look upon my fate as it approached
So I must have lain for hours continually beaten to and fro upon the billows now and again wetted with flying sprays and never ceasing to expect death at the next plunge Gradually weariness grew upon me a numbness an occasional stupor fell upon my mind even in the midst of my terrors until sleep at last supervened and in my sea-tossed coracle I lay and dreamed of home and the old Admiral Benbow
The Cruise of the Coracle
IT was broad day when I awoke and found myself tossing at the south-west end of Treasure Island The sun was up but was still hid from me behind the great bulk of the Spy-glass which on this side descended almost to the sea in formidable cliffs
Haulbowline Head and Mizzen-mast Hill were at my elbow the hill bare and dark the head bound with cliffs forty or fifty feet high and fringed with great masses of fallen rock I was scarce a quarter of a mile to seaward and it was my first thought to paddle in and land
That notion was soon given over Among the fallen rocks the breakers spouted and bellowed loud reverberations heavy sprays flying and falling succeeded one another from second to second and I saw myself if I ventured nearer dashed to death upon the rough shore or spending my strength in vain to scale the beetling crags
Nor was that all for crawling together on flat tables of rock or letting themselves drop into the sea with loud reports I beheld huge slimy monsterssoft snails as it were of incredible bignesstwo or three score of them together making the rocks to echo with their barkings
I have understood since that they were sea lions and entirely harmless But the look of them added to the difficulty of the shore and the high running of the surf was more than enough to disgust me of that landing-place I felt willing rather to starve at sea than to confront such perils
In the meantime I had a better chance as I supposed before me North of Haulbowline Head the land runs in a long way leaving at low tide a long stretch of yellow sand To the north of that again there comes another capeCape of the Woods as it was marked upon the chartburied in tall green pines which descended to the margin of the sea
I remembered what Silver had said about the current that sets northward along the whole west coast of Treasure Island and seeing from my position that I was already under its influence I preferred to leave Haulbowline Head behind me and reserve my strength for an attempt to land upon the kindlier-looking Cape of the Woods
There was a great smooth swell upon the sea The wind blowing steady and gentle from the south there was no contrariety between that and the current and the billows rose and fell unbroken
Had it been otherwise I must long ago have perished but as it was it is surprising how easily and securely my little and light boat could ride Often as I still lay at the bottom and kept no more than an eye above the gunwale I would see a big blue summit heaving close above me yet the coracle would but bounce a little dance as if on springs and subside on the other side into the trough as lightly as a bird
I began after a little to grow very bold and sat up to try my skill at paddling But even a small change in the disposition of the weight will produce violent changes in the behaviour of a coracle And I had hardly moved before the boat giving up at once her gentle dancing movement ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy and struck her nose with a spout of spray deep into the side of the next wave
I was drenched and terrified and fell instantly back into my old position whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows It was plain she was not to be interfered with and at that rate since I could in no way influence her course what hope had I left of reaching land
I began to be horribly frightened but I kept my head for all that First moving with all care I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap then getting my eye once more above the gunwale I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers
I found each wave instead of the big smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessels deck was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land full of peaks and smooth places and valleys The coracle left to herself turning from side to side threaded so to speak her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher toppling summits of the wave
Well now thought I to myself it is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time in smooth places give her a shove or two towards land No sooner thought upon than done There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore
It was very tiring and slow work yet I did visibly gain ground and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods though I saw I must infallibly miss that point I had still made some hundred yards of easting I was indeed close in I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail
It was high time for I now began to be tortured with thirst The glow of the sun from above its thousandfold reflection from the waves the sea-water that fell and dried upon me caking my very lips with salt combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing but the current had soon carried me past the point and as the next reach of sea opened out I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts
Right in front of me not half a mile away I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail I made sure of course that I should be taken but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought and long before I had come to a conclusion surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder
The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver When I first sighted her all her sails were drawing she was lying a course about north-west and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase At last however she fell right into the winds eye was taken dead aback and stood there awhile helpless with her sails shivering
Clumsy fellows said I they must still be drunk as owls And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping
Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack sailed swiftly for a minute or so and brought up once more dead in the winds eye Again and again was this repeated To and fro up and down north south east and west the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes and at each repetition ended as she had begun with idly flapping canvas It became plain to me that nobody was steering And if so where were the men Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her I thought and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain
The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate As for the latters sailing it was so wild and intermittent and she hung each time so long in irons that she certainly gained nothing if she did not even lose If only I dared to sit up and paddle I made sure that I could overhaul her The scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage
Up I got was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself with all my strength and caution to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail with my heart fluttering like a bird but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face
I was now gaining rapidly on the schooner I could see the brass glisten on the tiller as it banged about and still no soul appeared upon her decks I could not choose but suppose she was deserted If not the men were lying drunk below where I might batten them down perhaps and do what I chose with the ship
For some time she had been doing the worse thing possible for mestanding still She headed nearly due south yawing of course all the time Each time she fell off her sails partly filled and these brought her in a moment right to the wind again I have said this was the worst thing possible for me for helpless as she looked in this situation with the canvas cracking like cannon and the blocks trundling and banging on the deck she still continued to run away from me not only with the speed of the current but by the whole amount of her leeway which was naturally great
But now at last I had my chance The breeze fell for some seconds very low and the current gradually turning her the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day The main-sail hung drooped like a banner She was stock-still but for the current
For the last little while I had even lost but now redoubling my efforts I began once more to overhaul the chase
I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap she filled on the port tack and was off again stooping and skimming like a swallow
My first impulse was one of despair but my second was towards joy Round she came till she was broadside on to meround still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle
And then of a sudden I began to comprehend I had scarce time to thinkscarce time to act and save myself I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next The bowsprit was over my head I sprang to my feet and leaped stamping the coracle under water With one hand I caught the jib-boom while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace and as I still clung there panting a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA
I Strike the Jolly Roger
I HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack with a report like a gun The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse but next moment the other sails still drawing the jib flapped back again and hung idle
This had nearly tossed me off into the sea and now I lost no time crawled back along the bowsprit and tumbled head foremost on the deck
I was on the lee side of the forecastle and the mainsail which was still drawing concealed from me a certain portion of the after-deck Not a soul was to be seen The planks which had not been swabbed since the mutiny bore the print of many feet and an empty bottle broken by the neck tumbled to and fro like a live thing in the scuppers
Suddenly the HISPANIOLA came right into the wind The jibs behind me cracked aloud the rudder slammed to the whole ship gave a sickening heave and shudder and at the same moment the main-boom swung inboard the sheet groaning in the blocks and showed me the lee after-deck
There were the two watchmen sure enough red-cap on his back as stiff as a handspike with his arms stretched out like those of a crucifix and his teeth showing through his open lips Israel Hands propped against the bulwarks his chin on his chest his hands lying open before him on the deck his face as white under its tan as a tallow candle
For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse the sails filling now on one tack now on another and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ships bows against the swell so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made lop-sided coracle now gone to the bottom of the sea
At every jump of the schooner red-cap slipped to and fro butwhat was ghastly to beholdneither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage At every jump too Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck his feet sliding ever the farther out and the whole body canting towards the stern so that his face became little by little hid from me and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker
At the same time I observed around both of them splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath
While I was thus looking and wondering in a calm moment when the ship was still Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which I had seen him first The moan which told of pain and deadly weakness and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart But when I remembered the talk I had overheard from the apple barrel all pity left me
I walked aft until I reached the main-mast
Come aboard Mr Hands I said ironically
He rolled his eyes round heavily but he was too far gone to express surprise All he could do was to utter one word Brandy
It occurred to me there was no time to lose and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin
It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp The bulkheads all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt bore a pattern of dirty hands Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship One of the doctors medical books lay open on the table half of the leaves gutted out I suppose for pipelights In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow obscure and brown as umber
I went into the cellar all the barrels were gone and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away Certainly since the mutiny began not a man of them could ever have been sober
Foraging about I found a bottle with some brandy left for Hands and for myself I routed out some biscuit some pickled fruits a great bunch of raisins and a piece of cheese With these I came on deck put down my own stock behind the rudder head and well out of the coxswains reach went forward to the water-breaker and had a good deep drink of water and then and not till then gave Hands the brandy
He must have drunk a gill before he took the bottle from his mouth
Aye said he by thunder but I wanted some o that
I had sat down already in my own corner and begun to eat
Much hurt I asked him
He grunted or rather I might say he barked
If that doctor was aboard he said Id be right enough in a couple of turns but I dont have no manner of luck you see and thats whats the matter with me As for that swab hes good and dead he is he added indicating the man with the red cap He warnt no seaman anyhow And where mought you have come from
Well said I Ive come aboard to take possession of this ship Mr Hands and youll please regard me as your captain until further notice
He looked at me sourly enough but said nothing Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about
By the by I continued I cant have these colours Mr Hands and by your leave Ill strike em Better none than these
And again dodging the boom I ran to the colour lines handed down their cursed black flag and chucked it overboard
God save the king said I waving my cap And theres an end to Captain Silver
He watched me keenly and slyly his chin all the while on his breast
I reckon he said at last I reckon Capn Hawkins youll kind of want to get ashore now Spose we talks
Why yes says I with all my heart Mr Hands Say on And I went back to my meal with a good appetite
This man he began nodding feebly at the corpse OBrien were his name a rank Irelanderthis man and me got the canvas on her meaning for to sail her back Well HES dead now he isas dead as bilge and whos to sail this ship I dont see Without I gives you a hint you aint that man as fars I can tell Now look here you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up you do and Ill tell you how to sail her and thats about square all round I take it
Ill tell you one thing says I Im not going back to Captain Kidds anchorage I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there
To be sure you did he cried Why I aint sich an infernal lubber after all I can see cant I Ive tried my fling I have and Ive lost and its you has the wind of me North Inlet Why I havent no chice not I Id help you sail her up to Execution Dock by thunder So I would
Well as it seemed to me there was some sense in this We struck our bargain on the spot In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land
Then I lashed the tiller and went below to my own chest where I got a soft silk handkerchief of my mothers With this and with my aid Hands bound up the great bleeding stab he had received in the thigh and after he had eaten a little and had a swallow or two more of the brandy he began to pick up visibly sat straighter up spoke louder and clearer and looked in every way another man
The breeze served us admirably We skimmed before it like a bird the coast of the island flashing by and the view changing every minute Soon we were past the high lands and bowling beside low sandy country sparsely dotted with dwarf pines and soon we were beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north
I was greatly elated with my new command and pleased with the bright sunshiny weather and these different prospects of the coast I had now plenty of water and good things to eat and my conscience which had smitten me hard for my desertion was quieted by the great conquest I had made I should I think have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weaknessa haggard old mans smile but there was besides that a grain of derision a shadow of treachery in his expression as he craftily watched and watched and watched me at my work
Israel Hands
THE wind serving us to a desire now hauled into the west We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet Only as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther time hung on our hands The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to after a good many trials I succeeded and we both sat in silence over another meal
Capn said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile heres my old shipmate OBrien spose you was to heave him overboard I aint particlar as a rule and I dont take no blame for settling his hash but I dont reckon him ornamental now do you
Im not strong enough and I dont like the job and there he lies for me said I
This heres an unlucky ship this HISPANIOLA Jim he went on blinking Theres a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLAa sight o poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol I never seen sich dirty luck not I There was this here OBrien nowhes dead aint he Well now Im no scholar and youre a lad as can read and figure and to put it straight do you take it as a dead man is dead for good or do he come alive again
You can kill the body Mr Hands but not the spirit you must know that already I replied OBrien there is in another world and may be watching us
Ah says he Well thats unfortnateappears as if killing parties was a waste of time Howsomever sperrits dont reckon for much by what Ive seen Ill chance it with the sperrits Jim And now youve spoke up free and Ill take it kind if youd step down into that there cabin and get me awell ashiver my timbers I cant hit the name on t well you get me a bottle of wine Jimthis here brandys too strong for my head
Now the coxswains hesitation seemed to be unnatural and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy I entirely disbelieved it The whole story was a pretext He wanted me to leave the deckso much was plain but with what purpose I could in no way imagine His eyes never met mine they kept wandering to and fro up and down now with a look to the sky now with a flitting glance upon the dead OBrien All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty embarrassed manner so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception I was prompt with my answer however for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end
Some wine I said Far better Will you have white or red
Well I reckon its about the blessed same to me shipmate he replied so its strong and plenty of it whats the odds
All right I answered Ill bring you port Mr Hands But Ill have to dig for it
With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could slipped off my shoes ran quietly along the sparred gallery mounted the forecastle ladder and popped my head out of the fore companion I knew he would not expect to see me there yet I took every precaution possible and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true
He had risen from his position to his hands and knees and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he movedfor I could hear him stifle a groanyet it was at a good rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked out of a coil of rope a long knife or rather a short dirk discoloured to the hilt with blood He looked upon it for a moment thrusting forth his under jaw tried the point upon his hand and then hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark
This was all that I required to know Israel could move about he was now armed and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me it was plain that I was meant to be the victim What he would do afterwardswhether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom trusting that his own comrades might come first to help himwas of course more than I could say
Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point since in that our interests jumped together and that was in the disposition of the schooner We both desired to have her stranded safe enough in a sheltered place and so that when the time came she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared
While I was thus turning the business over in my mind I had not been idle with my body I had stolen back to the cabin slipped once more into my shoes and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine and now with this for an excuse I made my reappearance on the deck
Hands lay as I had left him all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light He looked up however at my coming knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often and took a good swig with his favourite toast of Heres luck Then he lay quiet for a little and then pulling out a stick of tobacco begged me to cut him a quid
Cut me a junk o that says he for I havent no knife and hardly strength enough so be as I had Ah Jim Jim I reckon Ive missed stays Cut me a quid asll likely be the last lad for Im for my long home and no mistake
Well said I Ill cut you some tobacco but if I was you and thought myself so badly I would go to my prayers like a Christian man
Why said he Now you tell me why
Why I cried You were asking me just now about the dead Youve broken your trust youve lived in sin and lies and blood theres a man you killed lying at your feet this moment and you ask me why For Gods mercy Mr Hands thats why
I spoke with a little heat thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed in his ill thoughts to end me with He for his part took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity
For thirty years he said Ive sailed the seas and seen good and bad better and worse fair weather and foul provisions running out knives going and what not Well now I tell you I never seen good come o goodness yet Him as strikes first is my fancy dead men dont bite thems my viewsamen so be it And now you look here he added suddenly changing his tone weve had about enough of this foolery The tides made good enough by now You just take my orders Capn Hawkins and well sail slap in and be done with it
All told we had scarce two miles to run but the navigation was delicate the entrance to this northern anchorage was not only narrow and shoal but lay east and west so that the schooner must be nicely handled to be got in I think I was a good prompt subaltern and I am very sure that Hands was an excellent pilot for we went about and about and dodged in shaving the banks with a certainty and a neatness that were a pleasure to behold
Scarcely had we passed the heads before the land closed around us The shores of North Inlet were as thickly wooded as those of the southern anchorage but the space was longer and narrower and more like what in truth it was the estuary of a river Right before us at the southern end we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers It was a sad sight but it showed us that the anchorage was calm
Now said Hands look there theres a pet bit for to beach a ship in Fine flat sand never a cats paw trees all around of it and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship
And once beached I inquired how shall we get her off again
Why so he replied you take a line ashore there on the other side at low water take a turn about one of them big pines bring it back take a turn around the capstan and lie to for the tide Come high water all hands take a pull upon the line and off she comes as sweet as natur And now boy you stand by Were near the bit now and shes too much way on her Starboard a littlesosteadystarboardlarboard a littlesteadysteady
So he issued his commands which I breathlessly obeyed till all of a sudden he cried Now my hearty luff And I put the helm hard up and the HISPANIOLA swung round rapidly and ran stem on for the low wooded shore
The excitement of these last manoeuvres had somewhat interfered with the watch I had kept hitherto sharply enough upon the coxswain Even then I was still so much interested waiting for the ship to touch that I had quite forgot the peril that hung over my head and stood craning over the starboard bulwarks and watching the ripples spreading wide before the bows I might have fallen without a struggle for my life had not a sudden disquietude seized upon me and made me turn my head Perhaps I had heard a creak or seen his shadow moving with the tail of my eye perhaps it was an instinct like a cats but sure enough when I looked round there was Hands already half-way towards me with the dirk in his right hand
We must both have cried out aloud when our eyes met but while mine was the shrill cry of terror his was a roar of fury like a charging bullys At the same instant he threw himself forward and I leapt sideways towards the bows As I did so I let go of the tiller which sprang sharp to leeward and I think this saved my life for it struck Hands across the chest and stopped him for the moment dead
Before he could recover I was safe out of the corner where he had me trapped with all the deck to dodge about Just forward of the main-mast I stopped drew a pistol from my pocket took a cool aim though he had already turned and was once more coming directly after me and drew the trigger The hammer fell but there followed neither flash nor sound the priming was useless with sea-water I cursed myself for my neglect Why had not I long before reprimed and reloaded my only weapons Then I should not have been as now a mere fleeing sheep before this butcher
Wounded as he was it was wonderful how fast he could move his grizzled hair tumbling over his face and his face itself as red as a red ensign with his haste and fury I had no time to try my other pistol nor indeed much inclination for I was sure it would be useless One thing I saw plainly I must not simply retreat before him or he would speedily hold me boxed into the bows as a moment since he had so nearly boxed me in the stern Once so caught and nine or ten inches of the blood-stained dirk would be my last experience on this side of eternity I placed my palms against the main-mast which was of a goodish bigness and waited every nerve upon the stretch
Seeing that I meant to dodge he also paused and a moment or two passed in feints on his part and corresponding movements upon mine It was such a game as I had often played at home about the rocks of Black Hill Cove but never before you may be sure with such a wildly beating heart as now Still as I say it was a boys game and I thought I could hold my own at it against an elderly seaman with a wounded thigh Indeed my courage had begun to rise so high that I allowed myself a few darting thoughts on what would be the end of the affair and while I saw certainly that I could spin it out for long I saw no hope of any ultimate escape
Well while things stood thus suddenly the HISPANIOLA struck staggered ground for an instant in the sand and then swift as a blow canted over to the port side till the deck stood at an angle of forty-five degrees and about a puncheon of water splashed into the scupper holes and lay in a pool between the deck and bulwark
We were both of us capsized in a second and both of us rolled almost together into the scuppers the dead red-cap with his arms still spread out tumbling stiffly after us So near were we indeed that my head came against the coxswains foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle Blow and all I was the first afoot again for Hands had got involved with the dead body The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on I had to find some new way of escape and that upon the instant for my foe was almost touching me Quick as thought I sprang into the mizzen shrouds rattled up hand over hand and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees
I had been saved by being prompt the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment
Now that I had a moment to myself I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol and then having one ready for service and to make assurance doubly sure I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning
My new employment struck Hands all of a heap he began to see the dice going against him and after an obvious hesitation he also hauled himself heavily into the shrouds and with the dirk in his teeth began slowly and painfully to mount It cost him no end of time and groans to haul his wounded leg behind him and I had quietly finished my arrangements before he was much more than a third of the way up Then with a pistol in either hand I addressed him
One more step Mr Hands said I and Ill blow your brains out Dead men dont bite you know I added with a chuckle
He stopped instantly I could see by the working of his face that he was trying to think and the process was so slow and laborious that in my new-found security I laughed aloud At last with a swallow or two he spoke his face still wearing the same expression of extreme perplexity In order to speak he had to take the dagger from his mouth but in all else he remained unmoved
Jim says he I reckon were fouled you and me and well have to sign articles Id have had you but for that there lurch but I dont have no luck not I and I reckon Ill have to strike which comes hard you see for a master mariner to a ships younker like you Jim
I was drinking in his words and smiling away as conceited as a cock upon a wall when all in a breath back went his right hand over his shoulder Something sang like an arrow through the air I felt a blow and then a sharp pang and there I was pinned by the shoulder to the mast In the horrid pain and surprise of the momentI scarce can say it was by my own volition and I am sure it was without a conscious aimboth my pistols went off and both escaped out of my hands They did not fall alone with a choked cry the coxswain loosed his grasp upon the shrouds and plunged head first into the water
Pieces of Eight
OWING to the cant of the vessel the masts hung far out over the water and from my perch on the cross-trees I had nothing below me but the surface of the bay Hands who was not so far up was in consequence nearer to the ship and fell between me and the bulwarks He rose once to the surface in a lather of foam and blood and then sank again for good As the water settled I could see him lying huddled together on the clean bright sand in the shadow of the vessels sides A fish or two whipped past his body Sometimes by the quivering of the water he appeared to move a little as if he were trying to rise But he was dead enough for all that being both shot and drowned and was food for fish in the very place where he had designed my slaughter
I was no sooner certain of this than I began to feel sick faint and terrified The hot blood was running over my back and chest The dirk where it had pinned my shoulder to the mast seemed to burn like a hot iron yet it was not so much these real sufferings that distressed me for these it seemed to me I could bear without a murmur it was the horror I had upon my mind of falling from the cross-trees into that still green water beside the body of the coxswain
I clung with both hands till my nails ached and I shut my eyes as if to cover up the peril Gradually my mind came back again my pulses quieted down to a more natural time and I was once more in possession of myself
It was my first thought to pluck forth the dirk but either it stuck too hard or my nerve failed me and I desisted with a violent shudder Oddly enough that very shudder did the business The knife in fact had come the nearest in the world to missing me altogether it held me by a mere pinch of skin and this the shudder tore away The blood ran down the faster to be sure but I was my own master again and only tacked to the mast by my coat and shirt
These last I broke through with a sudden jerk and then regained the deck by the starboard shrouds For nothing in the world would I have again ventured shaken as I was upon the overhanging port shrouds from which Israel had so lately fallen
I went below and did what I could for my wound it pained me a good deal and still bled freely but it was neither deep nor dangerous nor did it greatly gall me when I used my arm Then I looked around me and as the ship was now in a sense my own I began to think of clearing it from its last passengerthe dead man OBrien
He had pitched as I have said against the bulwarks where he lay like some horrible ungainly sort of puppet life-size indeed but how different from lifes colour or lifes comeliness In that position I could easily have my way with him and as the habit of tragical adventures had worn off almost all my terror for the dead I took him by the waist as if he had been a sack of bran and with one good heave tumbled him overboard He went in with a sounding plunge the red cap came off and remained floating on the surface and as soon as the splash subsided I could see him and Israel lying side by side both wavering with the tremulous movement of the water OBrien though still quite a young man was very bald There he lay with that bald head across the knees of the man who had killed him and the quick fishes steering to and fro over both
I was now alone upon the ship the tide had just turned The sun was within so few degrees of setting that already the shadow of the pines upon the western shore began to reach right across the anchorage and fall in patterns on the deck The evening breeze had sprung up and though it was well warded off by the hill with the two peaks upon the east the cordage had begun to sing a little softly to itself and the idle sails to rattle to and fro
I began to see a danger to the ship The jibs I speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck but the main-sail was a harder matter Of course when the schooner canted over the boom had swung out-board and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under water I thought this made it still more dangerous yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle At last I got my knife and cut the halyards The peak dropped instantly a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water and since pull as I liked I could not budge the downhall that was the extent of what I could accomplish For the rest the HISPANIOLA must trust to luck like myself
By this time the whole anchorage had fallen into shadowthe last rays I remember falling through a glade of the wood and shining bright as jewels on the flowery mantle of the wreck It began to be chill the tide was rapidly fleeting seaward the schooner settling more and more on her beam-ends
I scrambled forward and looked over It seemed shallow enough and holding the cut hawser in both hands for a last security I let myself drop softly overboard The water scarcely reached my waist the sand was firm and covered with ripple marks and I waded ashore in great spirits leaving the HISPANIOLA on her side with her main-sail trailing wide upon the surface of the bay About the same time the sun went fairly down and the breeze whistled low in the dusk among the tossing pines
At least and at last I was off the sea nor had I returned thence empty-handed There lay the schooner clear at last from buccaneers and ready for our own men to board and get to sea again I had nothing nearer my fancy than to get home to the stockade and boast of my achievements Possibly I might be blamed a bit for my truantry but the recapture of the HISPANIOLA was a clenching answer and I hoped that even Captain Smollett would confess I had not lost my time
So thinking and in famous spirits I began to set my face homeward for the block house and my companions I remembered that the most easterly of the rivers which drain into Captain Kidds anchorage ran from the two-peaked hill upon my left and I bent my course in that direction that I might pass the stream while it was small The wood was pretty open and keeping along the lower spurs I had soon turned the corner of that hill and not long after waded to the mid-calf across the watercourse
This brought me near to where I had encountered Ben Gunn the maroon and I walked more circumspectly keeping an eye on every side The dusk had come nigh hand completely and as I opened out the cleft between the two peaks I became aware of a wavering glow against the sky where as I judged the man of the island was cooking his supper before a roaring fire And yet I wondered in my heart that he should show himself so careless For if I could see this radiance might it not reach the eyes of Silver himself where he camped upon the shore among the marshes
Gradually the night fell blacker it was all I could do to guide myself even roughly towards my destination the double hill behind me and the Spy-glass on my right hand loomed faint and fainter the stars were few and pale and in the low ground where I wandered I kept tripping among bushes and rolling into sandy pits
Suddenly a kind of brightness fell about me I looked up a pale glimmer of moonbeams had alighted on the summit of the Spy-glass and soon after I saw something broad and silvery moving low down behind the trees and knew the moon had risen
With this to help me I passed rapidly over what remained to me of my journey and sometimes walking sometimes running impatiently drew near to the stockade Yet as I began to thread the grove that lies before it I was not so thoughtless but that I slacked my pace and went a trifle warily It would have been a poor end of my adventures to get shot down by my own party in mistake
The moon was climbing higher and higher its light began to fall here and there in masses through the more open districts of the wood and right in front of me a glow of a different colour appeared among the trees It was red and hot and now and again it was a little darkenedas it were the embers of a bonfire smouldering
For the life of me I could not think what it might be
At last I came right down upon the borders of the clearing The western end was already steeped in moonshine the rest and the block house itself still lay in a black shadow chequered with long silvery streaks of light On the other side of the house an immense fire had burned itself into clear embers and shed a steady red reverberation contrasted strongly with the mellow paleness of the moon There was not a soul stirring nor a sound beside the noises of the breeze
I stopped with much wonder in my heart and perhaps a little terror also It had not been our way to build great fires we were indeed by the captains orders somewhat niggardly of firewood and I began to fear that something had gone wrong while I was absent
I stole round by the eastern end keeping close in shadow and at a convenient place where the darkness was thickest crossed the palisade
To make assurance surer I got upon my hands and knees and crawled without a sound towards the corner of the house As I drew nearer my heart was suddenly and greatly lightened It is not a pleasant noise in itself and I have often complained of it at other times but just then it was like music to hear my friends snoring together so loud and peaceful in their sleep The sea-cry of the watch that beautiful Alls well never fell more reassuringly on my ear
In the meantime there was no doubt of one thing they kept an infamous bad watch If it had been Silver and his lads that were now creeping in on them not a soul would have seen daybreak That was what it was thought I to have the captain wounded and again I blamed myself sharply for leaving them in that danger with so few to mount guard
By this time I had got to the door and stood up All was dark within so that I could distinguish nothing by the eye As for sounds there was the steady drone of the snorers and a small occasional noise a flickering or pecking that I could in no way account for
With my arms before me I walked steadily in I should lie down in my own place I thought with a silent chuckle and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning
My foot struck something yieldingit was a sleepers leg and he turned and groaned but without awaking
And then all of a sudden a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness
Pieces of eight Pieces of eight Pieces of eight Pieces of eight Pieces of eight and so forth without pause or change like the clacking of a tiny mill
Silvers green parrot Captain Flint It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark it was she keeping better watch than any human being who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain
I had no time left me to recover At the sharp clipping tone of the parrot the sleepers awoke and sprang up and with a mighty oath the voice of Silver cried Who goes
I turned to run struck violently against one person recoiled and ran full into the arms of a second who for his part closed upon and held me tight
Bring a torch Dick said Silver when my capture was thus assured
And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand
PART SIXCaptain Silver
In the Enemys Camp
THE red glare of the torch lighting up the interior of the block house showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized The pirates were in possession of the house and stores there was the cask of cognac there were the pork and bread as before and what tenfold increased my horror not a sign of any prisoner I could only judge that all had perished and my heart smote me sorely that I had not been there to perish with them
There were six of the buccaneers all told not another man was left alive Five of them were on their feet flushed and swollen suddenly called out of the first sleep of drunkenness The sixth had only risen upon his elbow he was deadly pale and the blood-stained bandage round his head told that he had recently been wounded and still more recently dressed I remembered the man who had been shot and had run back among the woods in the great attack and doubted not that this was he
The parrot sat preening her plumage on Long Johns shoulder He himself I thought looked somewhat paler and more stern than I was used to He still wore the fine broadcloth suit in which he had fulfilled his mission but it was bitterly the worse for wear daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood
So said he heres Jim Hawkins shiver my timbers Dropped in like eh Well come I take that friendly
And thereupon he sat down across the brandy cask and began to fill a pipe
Give me a loan of the link Dick said he and then when he had a good light Thatll do lad he added stick the glim in the wood heap and you gentlemen bring yourselves to You neednt stand up for Mr Hawkins HELL excuse you you may lay to that And so Jimstopping the tobaccohere you were and quite a pleasant surprise for poor old John I see you were smart when first I set my eyes on you but this here gets away from me clean it do
To all this as may be well supposed I made no answer They had set me with my back against the wall and I stood there looking Silver in the face pluckily enough I hope to all outward appearance but with black despair in my heart
Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again
Now you see Jim so be as you ARE here says he Ill give you a piece of my mind Ive always liked you I have for a lad of spirit and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome I always wanted you to jine and take your share and die a gentleman and now my cock youve got to Capn Smolletts a fine seaman as Ill own up to any day but stiff on discipline Dooty is dooty says he and right he is Just you keep clear of the capn The doctor himself is gone dead again youungrateful scamp was what he said and the short and the long of the whole story is about here you cant go back to your own lot for they wont have you and without you start a third ships company all by yourself which might be lonely youll have to jine with Capn Silver
So far so good My friends then were still alive and though I partly believed the truth of Silvers statement that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard
I dont say nothing as to your being in our hands continued Silver though there you are and you may lay to it Im all for argyment I never seen good come out o threatening If you like the service well youll jine and if you dont Jim why youre free to answer nofree and welcome shipmate and if fairer can be said by mortal seaman shiver my sides
Am I to answer then I asked with a very tremulous voice Through all this sneering talk I was made to feel the threat of death that overhung me and my cheeks burned and my heart beat painfully in my breast
Lad said Silver no ones a-pressing of you Take your bearings None of us wont hurry you mate time goes so pleasant in your company you see
Well says I growing a bit bolder if Im to choose I declare I have a right to know whats what and why youre here and where my friends are
Wots wot repeated one of the buccaneers in a deep growl Ah hed be a lucky one as knowed that
Youll perhaps batten down your hatches till youre spoke to my friend cried Silver truculently to this speaker And then in his first gracious tones he replied to me Yesterday morning Mr Hawkins said he in the dog-watch down came Doctor Livesey with a flag of truce Says he Capn Silver youre sold out Ships gone Well maybe wed been taking a glass and a song to help it round I wont say no Leastways none of us had looked out We looked out and by thunder the old ship was gone I never seen a pack o fools look fishier and you may lay to that if I tells you that looked the fishiest Well says the doctor lets bargain We bargained him and I and here we are stores brandy block house the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut and in a manner of speaking the whole blessed boat from cross-trees to kelson As for them theyve tramped I dont know wheres they are
He drew again quietly at his pipe
And lest you should take it into that head of yours he went on that you was included in the treaty heres the last word that was said How many are you says I to leave Four says he four and one of us wounded As for that boy I dont know where he is confound him says he nor I dont much care Were about sick of him These was his words
Is that all I asked
Well its all that youre to hear my son returned Silver
And now I am to choose
And now you are to choose and you may lay to that said Silver
Well said I I am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for Let the worst come to the worst its little I care Ive seen too many die since I fell in with you But theres a thing or two I have to tell you I said and by this time I was quite excited and the first is this here you are in a bad wayship lost treasure lost men lost your whole business gone to wreck and if you want to know who did itit was I I was in the apple barrel the night we sighted land and I heard you John and you Dick Johnson and Hands who is now at the bottom of the sea and told every word you said before the hour was out And as for the schooner it was I who cut her cable and it was I that killed the men you had aboard of her and it was I who brought her where youll never see her more not one of you The laughs on my side Ive had the top of this business from the first I no more fear you than I fear a fly Kill me if you please or spare me But one thing Ill say and no more if you spare me bygones are bygones and when you fellows are in court for piracy Ill save you all I can It is for you to choose Kill another and do yourselves no good or spare me and keep a witness to save you from the gallows
I stopped for I tell you I was out of breath and to my wonder not a man of them moved but all sat staring at me like as many sheep And while they were still staring I broke out again And now Mr Silver I said I believe youre the best man here and if things go to the worst Ill take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took it
Ill bear it in mind said Silver with an accent so curious that I could not for the life of me decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage
Ill put one to that cried the old mahogany-faced seamanMorgan by namewhom I had seen in Long Johns public-house upon the quays of Bristol It was him that knowed Black Dog
Well and see here added the sea-cook Ill put another again to that by thunder For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones First and last weve split upon Jim Hawkins
Then here goes said Morgan with an oath
And he sprang up drawing his knife as if he had been twenty
Avast there cried Silver Who are you Tom Morgan Maybe you thought you was capn here perhaps By the powers but Ill teach you better Cross me and youll go where many a good mans gone before you first and last these thirty year backsome to the yard-arm shiver my timbers and some by the board and all to feed the fishes Theres never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day aterwards Tom Morgan you may lay to that
Morgan paused but a hoarse murmur rose from the others
Toms right said one
I stood hazing long enough from one added another Ill be hanged if Ill be hazed by you John Silver
Did any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME roared Silver bending far forward from his position on the keg with his pipe still glowing in his right hand Put a name on what youre at you aint dumb I reckon Him that wants shall get it Have I lived this many years and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it You know the way youre all gentlemen o fortune by your account Well Im ready Take a cutlass him that dares and Ill see the colour of his inside crutch and all before that pipes empty
Not a man stirred not a man answered
Thats your sort is it he added returning his pipe to his mouth Well youre a gay lot to look at anyway Not much worth to fight you aint Praps you can understand King Georges English Im capn here by lection Im capn here because Im the best man by a long sea-mile You wont fight as gentlemen o fortune should then by thunder youll obey and you may lay to it I like that boy now I never seen a better boy than that Hes more a man than any pair of rats of you in this here house and what I say is this let me see him thatll lay a hand on himthats what I say and you may lay to it
There was a long pause after this I stood straight up against the wall my heart still going like a sledge-hammer but with a ray of hope now shining in my bosom Silver leant back against the wall his arms crossed his pipe in the corner of his mouth as calm as though he had been in church yet his eye kept wandering furtively and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers They on their part drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously like a stream One after another they would look up and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces but it was not towards me it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes
You seem to have a lot to say remarked Silver spitting far into the air Pipe up and let me hear it or lay to
Ax your pardon sir returned one of the men youre pretty free with some of the rules maybe youll kindly keep an eye upon the rest This crews dissatisfied this crew dont vally bullying a marlin-spike this crew has its rights like other crews Ill make so free as that and by your own rules I take it we can talk together I ax your pardon sir acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present but I claim my right and steps outside for a council
And with an elaborate sea-salute this fellow a long ill-looking yellow-eyed man of five and thirty stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house One after another the rest followed his example each making a salute as he passed each adding some apology According to rules said one Forecastle council said Morgan And so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the torch
The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe
Now look you here Jim Hawkins he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible youre within half a plank of death and whats a long sight worse of torture Theyre going to throw me off But you mark I stand by you through thick and thin I didnt mean to no not till you spoke up I was about desperate to lose that much blunt and be hanged into the bargain But I see you was the right sort I says to myself you stand by Hawkins John and Hawkinsll stand by you Youre his last card and by the living thunder John hes yours Back to back says I You save your witness and hell save your neck
I began dimly to understand
You mean alls lost I asked
Aye by gum I do he answered Ship gone neck gonethats the size of it Once I looked into that bay Jim Hawkins and seen no schoonerwell Im tough but I gave out As for that lot and their council mark me theyre outright fools and cowards Ill save your lifeif so be as I canfrom them But see here Jimtit for tatyou save Long John from swinging
I was bewildered it seemed a thing so hopeless he was askinghe the old buccaneer the ringleader throughout
What I can do that Ill do I said
Its a bargain cried Long John You speak up plucky and by thunder Ive a chance
He hobbled to the torch where it stood propped among the firewood and took a fresh light to his pipe
Understand me Jim he said returning Ive a head on my shoulders I have Im on squires side now I know youve got that ship safe somewheres How you done it I dont know but safe it is I guess Hands and OBrien turned soft I never much believed in neither of THEM Now you mark me I ask no questions nor I wont let others I know when a games up I do and I know a lad thats staunch Ah you thats youngyou and me might have done a power of good together
He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin
Will you taste messmate he asked and when I had refused Well Ill take a drain myself Jim said he I need a caulker for theres trouble on hand And talking o trouble why did that doctor give me the chart Jim
My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions
Ah well he did though said he And theres something under that no doubtsomething surely under that Jimbad or good
And he took another swallow of the brandy shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst
The Black Spot Again
THE council of buccaneers had lasted some time when one of them re-entered the house and with a repetition of the same salute which had in my eyes an ironical air begged for a moments loan of the torch Silver briefly agreed and this emissary retired again leaving us together in the dark
Theres a breeze coming Jim said Silver who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone
I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch About half-way down the slope to the stockade they were collected in a group one held the light another was on his knees in their midst and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight The rest were all somewhat stooping as though watching the manoeuvres of this last I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house
Here they come said I and I returned to my former position for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them
Well let em come ladlet em come said Silver cheerily Ive still a shot in my locker
The door opened and the five men standing huddled together just inside pushed one of their number forward In any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance hesitating as he set down each foot but holding his closed right hand in front of him
Step up lad cried Silver I wont eat you Hand it over lubber I know the rules I do I wont hurt a depytation
Thus encouraged the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly and having passed something to Silver from hand to hand slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions
The sea-cook looked at what had been given him
The black spot I thought so he observed Where might you have got the paper Why hillo Look here now this aint lucky Youve gone and cut this out of a Bible What fools cut a Bible
Ah there said Morgan There Wot did I say No goodll come o that I said
Well youve about fixed it now among you continued Silver Youll all swing now I reckon What soft-headed lubber had a Bible
It was Dick said one
Dick was it Then Dick can get to prayers said Silver Hes seen his slice of luck has Dick and you may lay to that
But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in
Belay that talk John Silver he said This crew has tipped you the black spot in full council as in dooty bound just you turn it over as in dooty bound and see whats wrote there Then you can talk
Thanky George replied the sea-cook You always was brisk for business and has the rules by heart George as Im pleased to see Well what is it anyway Ah Deposedthats it is it Very pretty wrote to be sure like print I swear Your hand o write George Why you was gettin quite a leadin man in this here crew Youll be capn next I shouldnt wonder Just oblige me with that torch again will you This pipe dont draw
Come now said George you dont fool this crew no more Youre a funny man by your account but youre over now and youll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote
I thought you said you knowed the rules returned Silver contemptuously Leastways if you dont I do and I wait hereand Im still your capn mindtill you outs with your grievances and I reply in the meantime your black spot aint worth a biscuit After that well see
Oh replied George you dont be under no kind of apprehension WERE all square we are First youve made a hash of this cruiseyoull be a bold man to say no to that Second you let the enemy out o this here trap for nothing Why did they want out I dunno but its pretty plain they wanted it Third you wouldnt let us go at them upon the march Oh we see through you John Silver you want to play booty thats whats wrong with you And then fourth theres this here boy
Is that all asked Silver quietly
Enough too retorted George Well all swing and sun-dry for your bungling
Well now look here Ill answer these four pints one after another Ill answer em I made a hash o this cruise did I Well now you all know what I wanted and you all know if that had been done that wed a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was every man of us alive and fit and full of good plum-duff and the treasure in the hold of her by thunder Well who crossed me Who forced my hand as was the lawful capn Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance Ah its a fine danceIm with you thereand looks mighty like a hornpipe in a ropes end at Execution Dock by London town it does But who done it Why it was Anderson and Hands and you George Merry And youre the last above board of that same meddling crew and you have the Davy Joness insolence to up and stand for capn over meyou that sank the lot of us By the powers But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing
Silver paused and I could see by the faces of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain
Thats for number one cried the accused wiping the sweat from his brow for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house Why I give you my word Im sick to speak to you Youve neither sense nor memory and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea Sea Gentlemen o fortune I reckon tailors is your trade
Go on John said Morgan Speak up to the others
Ah the others returned John Theyre a nice lot aint they You say this cruise is bungled Ah By gum if you could understand how bad its bungled you would see Were that near the gibbet that my necks stiff with thinking on it Youve seen em maybe hanged in chains birds about em seamen pinting em out as they go down with the tide Whos that says one That Why thats John Silver I knowed him well says another And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy Now thats about where we are every mothers son of us thanks to him and Hands and Anderson and other ruination fools of you And if you want to know about number four and that boy why shiver my timbers isnt he a hostage Are we a-going to waste a hostage No not us he might be our last chance and I shouldnt wonder Kill that boy Not me mates And number three Ah well theres a deal to say to number three Maybe you dont count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every dayyou John with your head brokeor you George Merry that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock And maybe perhaps you didnt know there was a consort coming either But there is and not so long till then and well see wholl be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that And as for number two and why I made a bargainwell you came crawling on your knees to me to make iton your knees you came you was that downheartedand youd have starved too if I hadntbut thats a trifle You look therethats why
And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognizednone other than the chart on yellow paper with the three red crosses that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captains chest Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy
But if it were inexplicable to me the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse It went from hand to hand one tearing it from another and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination you would have thought not only they were fingering the very gold but were at sea with it besides in safety
Yes said one thats Flint sure enough J F and a score below with a clove hitch to it so he done ever
Mighty pretty said George But how are we to get away with it and us no ship
Silver suddenly sprang up and supporting himself with a hand against the wall Now I give you warning George he cried One more word of your sauce and Ill call you down and fight you How Why how do I know You had ought to tell me thatyou and the rest that lost me my schooner with your interference burn you But not you you cant you haint got the invention of a cockroach But civil you can speak and shall George Merry you may lay to that
Thats fair enow said the old man Morgan
Fair I reckon so said the sea-cook You lost the ship I found the treasure Whos the better man at that And now I resign by thunder Elect whom you please to be your capn now Im done with it
Silver they cried Barbecue forever Barbecue for capn
So thats the toon is it cried the cook George I reckon youll have to wait another turn friend and lucky for you as Im not a revengeful man But that was never my way And now shipmates this black spot Taint much good now is it Dicks crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible and thats about all
Itll do to kiss the book on still wont it growled Dick who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself
A Bible with a bit cut out returned Silver derisively Not it It dont bind no moren a ballad-book
Dont it though cried Dick with a sort of joy Well I reckon thats worth having too
Here Jimheres a curosity for you said Silver and he tossed me the paper
It was around about the size of a crown piece One side was blank for it had been the last leaf the other contained a verse or two of Revelationthese words among the rest which struck sharply home upon my mind Without are dogs and murderers The printed side had been blackened with wood ash which already began to come off and soil my fingers on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word Depposed I have that curiosity beside me at this moment but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch such as a man might make with his thumb-nail
That was the end of the nights business Soon after with a drink all round we lay down to sleep and the outside of Silvers vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful
It was long ere I could close an eye and heaven knows I had matter enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon in my own most perilous position and above all in the remarkable game that I saw Silver now engaged uponkeeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means possible and impossible to make his peace and save his miserable life He himself slept peacefully and snored aloud yet my heart was sore for him wicked as he was to think on the dark perils that environed and the shameful gibbet that awaited him
On Parole
I WAS wakenedindeed we were all wakened for I could see even the sentinel shake himself together from where he had fallen against the door-postby a clear hearty voice hailing us from the margin of the wood
Block house ahoy it cried Heres the doctor
And the doctor it was Although I was glad to hear the sound yet my gladness was not without admixture I remembered with confusion my insubordinate and stealthy conduct and when I saw where it had brought meamong what companions and surrounded by what dangersI felt ashamed to look him in the face
He must have risen in the dark for the day had hardly come and when I ran to a loophole and looked out I saw him standing like Silver once before up to the mid-leg in creeping vapour
You doctor Top o the morning to you sir cried Silver broad awake and beaming with good nature in a moment Bright and early to be sure and its the early bird as the saying goes that gets the rations George shake up your timbers son and help Dr Livesey over the ships side All a-doin well your patients wasall well and merry
So he pattered on standing on the hilltop with his crutch under his elbow and one hand upon the side of the log-housequite the old John in voice manner and expression
Weve quite a surprise for you too sir he continued Weve a little stranger herehe he A noo boarder and lodger sir and looking fit and taut as a fiddle slep like a supercargo he did right alongside of Johnstem to stem we was all night
Dr Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said Not Jim
The very same Jim as ever was says Silver
The doctor stopped outright although he did not speak and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on
Well well he said at last duty first and pleasure afterwards as you might have said yourself Silver Let us overhaul these patients of yours
A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick He seemed under no apprehension though he must have known that his life among these treacherous demons depended on a hair and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet English family His manner I suppose reacted on the men for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred as if he were still ships doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast
Youre doing well my friend he said to the fellow with the bandaged head and if ever any person had a close shave it was you your head must be as hard as iron Well George how goes it Youre a pretty colour certainly why your liver man is upside down Did you take that medicine Did he take that medicine men
Aye aye sir he took it sure enough returned Morgan
Because you see since I am mutineers doctor or prison doctor as I prefer to call it says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way I make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George God bless him and the gallows
The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in silence
Dick dont feel well sir said one
Dont he replied the doctor Well step up here Dick and let me see your tongue No I should be surprised if he did The mans tongue is fit to frighten the French Another fever
Ah there said Morgan that comed of spiling Bibles
That comesas you call itof being arrant asses retorted the doctor and not having sense enough to know honest air from poison and the dry land from a vile pestiferous slough I think it most probablethough of course its only an opinionthat youll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems Camp in a bog would you Silver Im surprised at you Youre less of a fool than many take you all round but you dont appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health
Well he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions with really laughable humility more like charity schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirateswell thats done for today And now I should wish to have a talk with that boy please
And he nodded his head in my direction carelessly
George Merry was at the door spitting and spluttering over some bad-tasted medicine but at the first word of the doctors proposal he swung round with a deep flush and cried No and swore
Silver struck the barrel with his open hand
Si-lence he roared and looked about him positively like a lion Doctor he went on in his usual tones I was a-thinking of that knowing as how you had a fancy for the boy Were all humbly grateful for your kindness and as you see puts faith in you and takes the drugs down like that much grog And I take it Ive found a way asll suit all Hawkins will you give me your word of honour as a young gentlemanfor a young gentleman you are although poor bornyour word of honour not to slip your cable
I readily gave the pledge required
Then doctor said Silver you just step outside o that stockade and once youre there Ill bring the boy down on the inside and I reckon you can yarn through the spars Good day to you sir and all our dooties to the squire and Capn Smollett
The explosion of disapproval which nothing but Silvers black looks had restrained broke out immediately the doctor had left the house Silver was roundly accused of playing doubleof trying to make a separate peace for himself of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims and in one word of the identical exact thing that he was doing It seemed to me so obvious in this case that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger But he was twice the man the rest were and his last nights victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor fluttered the chart in their faces asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting
No by thunder he cried Its us must break the treaty when the time comes and till then Ill gammon that doctor if I have to ile his boots with brandy
And then he bade them get the fire lit and stalked out upon his crutch with his hand on my shoulder leaving them in a disarray and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced
Slow lad slow he said They might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry
Very deliberately then did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped
Youll make a note of this here also doctor says he and the boyll tell you how I saved his life and were deposed for it too and you may lay to that Doctor when a mans steering as near the wind as meplaying chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body likeyou wouldnt think it too much mayhap to give him one good word Youll please bear in mind its not my life only nowits that boys into the bargain and youll speak me fair doctor and give me a bit o hope to go on for the sake of mercy
Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house his cheeks seemed to have fallen in his voice trembled never was a soul more dead in earnest
Why John youre not afraid asked Dr Livesey
Doctor Im no coward no not Inot SO much and he snapped his fingers If I was I wouldnt say it But Ill own up fairly Ive the shakes upon me for the gallows Youre a good man and a true I never seen a better man And youll not forget what I done good not any more than youll forget the bad I know And I step asidesee hereand leave you and Jim alone And youll put that down for me too for its a long stretch is that
So saying he stepped back a little way till he was out of earshot and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the firewhich they were busy rekindlingand the house from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast
So Jim said the doctor sadly here you are As you have brewed so shall you drink my boy Heaven knows I cannot find it in my heart to blame you but this much I will say be it kind or unkind when Captain Smollett was well you dared not have gone off and when he was ill and couldnt help it by George it was downright cowardly
I will own that I here began to weep Doctor I said you might spare me I have blamed myself enough my lifes forfeit anyway and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadnt stood for me and doctor believe this I can dieand I dare say I deserve itbut what I fear is torture If they come to torture me
Jim the doctor interrupted and his voice was quite changed Jim I cant have this Whip over and well run for it
Doctor said I I passed my word
I know I know he cried We cant help that Jim now Ill take it on my shoulders holus bolus blame and shame my boy but stay here I cannot let you Jump One jump and youre out and well run for it like antelopes
No I replied you know right well you wouldnt do the thing yourselfneither you nor squire nor captain and no more will I Silver trusted me I passed my word and back I go But doctor you did not let me finish If they come to torture me I might let slip a word of where the ship is for I got the ship part by luck and part by risking and she lies in North Inlet on the southern beach and just below high water At half tide she must be high and dry
The ship exclaimed the doctor
Rapidly I described to him my adventures and he heard me out in silence
There is a kind of fate in this he observed when I had done Every step its you that saves our lives and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours That would be a poor return my boy You found out the plot you found Ben Gunnthe best deed that ever you did or will do though you live to ninety Oh by Jupiter and talking of Ben Gunn Why this is the mischief in person Silver he cried Silver Ill give you a piece of advice he continued as the cook drew near again dont you be in any great hurry after that treasure
Why sir I do my possible which that aint said Silver I can only asking your pardon save my life and the boys by seeking for that treasure and you may lay to that
Well Silver replied the doctor if that is so Ill go one step further look out for squalls when you find it
Sir said Silver as between man and man thats too much and too little What youre after why you left the block house why you given me that there chart I dont know now do I And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope But no this heres too much If you wont tell me what you mean plain out just say so and Ill leave the helm
No said the doctor musingly Ive no right to say more its not my secret you see Silver or I give you my word Id tell it you But Ill go as far with you as I dare go and a step beyond for Ill have my wig sorted by the captain or Im mistaken And first Ill give you a bit of hope Silver if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap Ill do my best to save you short of perjury
Silvers face was radiant You couldnt say more Im sure sir not if you was my mother he cried
Well thats my first concession added the doctor My second is a piece of advice keep the boy close beside you and when you need help halloo Im off to seek it for you and that itself will show you if I speak at random Good-bye Jim
And Dr Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade nodded to Silver and set off at a brisk pace into the wood
The Treasure-huntFlints Pointer
JIM said Silver when we were alone if I saved your life you saved mine and Ill not forget it I seen the doctor waving you to run for itwith the tail of my eye I did and I seen you say no as plain as hearing Jim thats one to you This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed and I owe it you And now Jim were to go in for this here treasure-hunting with sealed orders too and I dont like it and you and me must stick close back to back like and well save our necks in spite o fate and fortune
Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward and even there not without precaution In the same wasteful spirit they had cooked I suppose three times more than we could eat and one of them with an empty laugh threw what was left into the fire which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign
Even Silver eating away with Captain Flint upon his shoulder had not a word of blame for their recklessness And this the more surprised me for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then
Aye mates said he its lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head I got what I wanted I did Sure enough they have the ship Where they have it I dont know yet but once we hit the treasure well have to jump about and find out And then mates us that has the boats I reckon has the upper hand
Thus he kept running on with his mouth full of the hot bacon thus he restored their hope and confidence and I more than suspect repaired his own at the same time
As for hostage he continued thats his last talk I guess with them he loves so dear Ive got my piece o news and thanky to him for that but its over and done Ill take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting for well keep him like so much gold in case of accidents you mark and in the meantime Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions why then well talk Mr Hawkins over we will and well give him his share to be sure for all his kindness
It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now For my part I was horribly cast down Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible Silver already doubly a traitor would not hesitate to adopt it He had still a foot in either camp and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging which was the best he had to hope on our side
Nay and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr Livesey even then what danger lay before us What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear lifehe a cripple and I a boyagainst five strong and active seamen
Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends their unexplained desertion of the stockade their inexplicable cession of the chart or harder still to understand the doctors last warning to Silver Look out for squalls when you find it and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure
We made a curious figure had anyone been there to see usall in soiled sailor clothes and all but me armed to the teeth Silver had two guns slung about himone before and one behindbesides the great cutlass at his waist and a pistol in each pocket of his square-tailed coat To complete his strange appearance Captain Flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk I had a line about my waist and followed obediently after the sea-cook who held the loose end of the rope now in his free hand now between his powerful teeth For all the world I was led like a dancing bear
The other men were variously burthened some carrying picks and shovelsfor that had been the very first necessary they brought ashore from the HISPANIOLAothers laden with pork bread and brandy for the midday meal All the stores I observed came from our stock and I could see the truth of Silvers words the night before Had he not struck a bargain with the doctor he and his mutineers deserted by the ship must have been driven to subsist on clear water and the proceeds of their hunting Water would have been little to their taste a sailor is not usually a good shot and besides all that when they were so short of eatables it was not likely they would be very flush of powder
Well thus equipped we all set outeven the fellow with the broken head who should certainly have kept in shadowand straggled one after another to the beach where the two gigs awaited us Even these bore trace of the drunken folly of the pirates one in a broken thwart and both in their muddy and unbailed condition Both were to be carried along with us for the sake of safety and so with our numbers divided between them we set forth upon the bosom of the anchorage
As we pulled over there was some discussion on the chart The red cross was of course far too large to be a guide and the terms of the note on the back as you will hear admitted of some ambiguity They ran the reader may remember thus
A tall tree was thus the principal mark Now right before us the anchorage was bounded by a plateau from two to three hundred feet high adjoining on the north the sloping southern shoulder of the Spy-glass and rising again towards the south into the rough cliffy eminence called the Mizzen-mast Hill The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height Every here and there one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours and which of these was the particular tall tree of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot and by the readings of the compass
Yet although that was the case every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there
We pulled easily by Silvers directions not to weary the hands prematurely and after quite a long passage landed at the mouth of the second riverthat which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass Thence bending to our left we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau
At the first outset heavy miry ground and a matted marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order It was indeed a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others The air besides was fresh and stirring and this under the sheer sunbeams was a wonderful refreshment to our senses
The party spread itself abroad in a fan shape shouting and leaping to and fro About the centre and a good way behind the rest Silver and I followedI tethered by my rope he ploughing with deep pants among the sliding gravel From time to time indeed I had to lend him a hand or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill
We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud as if in terror Shout after shout came from him and the others began to run in his direction
He cant a found the treasure said old Morgan hurrying past us from the right for thats clean a-top
Indeed as we found when we also reached the spot it was something very different At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones a human skeleton lay with a few shreds of clothing on the ground I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart
He was a seaman said George Merry who bolder than the rest had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing Leastways this is good sea-cloth
Aye aye said Silver like enough you wouldnt look to find a bishop here I reckon But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie Taint in natur
Indeed on a second glance it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position But for some disarray the work perhaps of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains the man lay perfectly straighthis feet pointing in one direction his hands raised above his head like a divers pointing directly in the opposite
Ive taken a notion into my old numbskull observed Silver Heres the compass theres the tip-top pint o Skeleton Island stickin out like a tooth Just take a bearing will you along the line of them bones
It was done The body pointed straight in the direction of the island and the compass read duly ESE and by E
I thought so cried the cook this here is a pinter Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars But by thunder If it dont make me cold inside to think of Flint This is one of HIS jokes and no mistake Him and these six was alone here he killed em every man and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass shiver my timbers Theyre long bones and the hairs been yellow Aye that would be Allardyce You mind Allardyce Tom Morgan
Aye aye returned Morgan I mind him he owed me money he did and took my knife ashore with him
Speaking of knives said another why dont we find hisn lying round Flint warnt the man to pick a seamans pocket and the birds I guess would leave it be
By the powers and thats true cried Silver
There aint a thing left here said Merry still feeling round among the bones not a copper doit nor a baccy box It dont look natral to me
No by gum it dont agreed Silver not natral nor not nice says you Great guns Messmates but if Flint was living this would be a hot spot for you and me Six they were and six are we and bones is what they are now
I saw him dead with these here deadlights said Morgan Billy took me in There he laid with penny-pieces on his eyes
Deadaye sure enough hes dead and gone below said the fellow with the bandage but if ever sperrit walked it would be Flints Dear heart but he died bad did Flint
Aye that he did observed another now he raged and now he hollered for the rum and now he sang Fifteen Men were his only song mates and I tell you true I never rightly liked to hear it since It was main hot and the windy was open and I hear that old song comin out as clear as clearand the death-haul on the man already
Come come said Silver stow this talk Hes dead and he dont walk that I know leastways he wont walk by day and you may lay to that Care killed a cat Fetch ahead for the doubloons
We started certainly but in spite of the hot sun and the staring daylight the pirates no longer ran separate and shouting through the wood but kept side by side and spoke with bated breath The terror of the dead buccaneer had fallen on their spirits
The Treasure-huntThe Voice Among the Trees
PARTLY from the damping influence of this alarm partly to rest Silver and the sick folk the whole party sat down as soon as they had gained the brow of the ascent
The plateau being somewhat tilted towards the west this spot on which we had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand Before us over the tree-tops we beheld the Cape of the Woods fringed with surf behind we not only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton Island but sawclear across the spit and the eastern lowlandsa great field of open sea upon the east Sheer above us rose the Spyglass here dotted with single pines there black with precipices There was no sound but that of the distant breakers mounting from all round and the chirp of countless insects in the brush Not a man not a sail upon the sea the very largeness of the view increased the sense of solitude
Silver as he sat took certain bearings with his compass
There are three tall trees said he about in the right line from Skeleton Island Spy-glass shoulder I take it means that lower pint there Its childs play to find the stuff now Ive half a mind to dine first
I dont feel sharp growled Morgan Thinkin o FlintI think it wereas done me
Ah well my son you praise your stars hes dead said Silver
He were an ugly devil cried a third pirate with a shudder that blue in the face too
That was how the rum took him added Merry Blue Well I reckon he was blue Thats a true word
Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought they had spoken lower and lower and they had almost got to whispering by now so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood All of a sudden out of the middle of the trees in front of us a thin high trembling voice struck up the well-known air and words
I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates The colour went from their six faces like enchantment some leaped to their feet some clawed hold of others Morgan grovelled on the ground
Its Flint by  cried Merry
The song had stopped as suddenly as it beganbroken off you would have said in the middle of a note as though someone had laid his hand upon the singers mouth Coming through the clear sunny atmosphere among the green tree-tops I thought it had sounded airily and sweetly and the effect on my companions was the stranger
Come said Silver struggling with his ashen lips to get the word out this wont do Stand by to go about This is a rum start and I cant name the voice but its someone skylarkingsomeone thats flesh and blood and you may lay to that
His courage had come back as he spoke and some of the colour to his face along with it Already the others had begun to lend an ear to this encouragement and were coming a little to themselves when the same voice broke out againnot this time singing but in a faint distant hail that echoed yet fainter among the clefts of the Spy-glass
Darby MGraw it wailedfor that is the word that best describes the soundDarby MGraw Darby MGraw again and again and again and then rising a little higher and with an oath that I leave out Fetch aft the rum Darby
The buccaneers remained rooted to the ground their eyes starting from their heads Long after the voice had died away they still stared in silence dreadfully before them
That fixes it gasped one Lets go
They was his last words moaned Morgan his last words above board
Dick had his Bible out and was praying volubly He had been well brought up had Dick before he came to sea and fell among bad companions
Still Silver was unconquered I could hear his teeth rattle in his head but he had not yet surrendered
Nobody in this here island ever heard of Darby he muttered not one but us thats here And then making a great effort Shipmates he cried Im here to get that stuff and Ill not be beat by man or devil I never was feared of Flint in his life and by the powers Ill face him dead Theres seven hundred thousand pound not a quarter of a mile from here When did ever a gentleman o fortune show his stern to that much dollars for a boozy old seaman with a blue mugand him dead too
But there was no sign of reawakening courage in his followers rather indeed of growing terror at the irreverence of his words
Belay there John said Merry Dont you cross a sperrit
And the rest were all too terrified to reply They would have run away severally had they dared but fear kept them together and kept them close by John as if his daring helped them He on his part had pretty well fought his weakness down
Sperrit Well maybe he said But theres one thing not clear to me There was an echo Now no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow well then whats he doing with an echo to him I should like to know That aint in natur surely
This argument seemed weak enough to me But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious and to my wonder George Merry was greatly relieved
Well thats so he said Youve a head upon your shoulders John and no mistake Bout ship mates This here crew is on a wrong tack I do believe And come to think on it it was like Flints voice I grant you but not just so clear-away like it after all It was liker somebody elses voice nowit was liker
By the powers Ben Gunn roared Silver
Aye and so it were cried Morgan springing on his knees Ben Gunn it were
It dont make much odds do it now asked Dick Ben Gunns not here in the body any moren Flint
But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn
Why nobody minds Ben Gunn cried Merry dead or alive nobody minds him
It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces Soon they were chatting together with intervals of listening and not long after hearing no further sound they shouldered the tools and set forth again Merry walking first with Silvers compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island He had said the truth dead or alive nobody minded Ben Gunn
Dick alone still held his Bible and looked around him as he went with fearful glances but he found no sympathy and Silver even joked him on his precautions
I told you said heI told you you had spiled your Bible If it aint no good to swear by what do you suppose a sperrit would give for it Not that and he snapped his big fingers halting a moment on his crutch
But Dick was not to be comforted indeed it was soon plain to me that the lad was falling sick hastened by heat exhaustion and the shock of his alarm the fever predicted by Dr Livesey was evidently growing swiftly higher
It was fine open walking here upon the summit our way lay a little downhill for as I have said the plateau tilted towards the west The pines great and small grew wide apart and even between the clumps of nutmeg and azalea wide open spaces baked in the hot sunshine Striking as we did pretty near north-west across the island we drew on the one hand ever nearer under the shoulders of the Spy-glass and on the other looked ever wider over that western bay where I had once tossed and trembled in the coracle
The first of the tall trees was reached and by the bearings proved the wrong one So with the second The third rose nearly two hundred feet into the air above a clump of underwooda giant of a vegetable with a red column as big as a cottage and a wide shadow around in which a company could have manoeuvred It was conspicuous far to sea both on the east and west and might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart
But it was not its size that now impressed my companions it was the knowledge that seven hundred thousand pounds in gold lay somewhere buried below its spreading shadow The thought of the money as they drew nearer swallowed up their previous terrors Their eyes burned in their heads their feet grew speedier and lighter their whole soul was found up in that fortune that whole lifetime of extravagance and pleasure that lay waiting there for each of them
Silver hobbled grunting on his crutch his nostrils stood out and quivered he cursed like a madman when the flies settled on his hot and shiny countenance he plucked furiously at the line that held me to him and from time to time turned his eyes upon me with a deadly look Certainly he took no pains to hide his thoughts and certainly I read them like print In the immediate nearness of the gold all else had been forgotten his promise and the doctors warning were both things of the past and I could not doubt that he hoped to seize upon the treasure find and board the HISPANIOLA under cover of night cut every honest throat about that island and sail away as he had at first intended laden with crimes and riches
Shaken as I was with these alarms it was hard for me to keep up with the rapid pace of the treasure-hunters Now and again I stumbled and it was then that Silver plucked so roughly at the rope and launched at me his murderous glances Dick who had dropped behind us and now brought up the rear was babbling to himself both prayers and curses as his fever kept rising This also added to my wretchedness and to crown all I was haunted by the thought of the tragedy that had once been acted on that plateau when that ungodly buccaneer with the blue facehe who died at Savannah singing and shouting for drinkhad there with his own hand cut down his six accomplices This grove that was now so peaceful must then have rung with cries I thought and even with the thought I could believe I heard it ringing still
We were now at the margin of the thicket
Huzza mates all together shouted Merry and the foremost broke into a run
And suddenly not ten yards further we beheld them stop A low cry arose Silver doubled his pace digging away with the foot of his crutch like one possessed and next moment he and I had come also to a dead halt
Before us was a great excavation not very recent for the sides had fallen in and grass had sprouted on the bottom In this were the shaft of a pick broken in two and the boards of several packing-cases strewn around On one of these boards I saw branded with a hot iron the name WALRUSthe name of Flints ship
All was clear to probation The CACHE had been found and rifled the seven hundred thousand pounds were gone
The Fall of a Chieftain
THERE never was such an overturn in this world Each of these six men was as though he had been struck But with Silver the blow passed almost instantly Every thought of his soul had been set full-stretch like a racer on that money well he was brought up in a single second dead and he kept his head found his temper and changed his plan before the others had had time to realize the disappointment
Jim he whispered take that and stand by for trouble
And he passed me a double-barrelled pistol
At the same time he began quietly moving northward and in a few steps had put the hollow between us two and the other five Then he looked at me and nodded as much as to say Here is a narrow corner as indeed I thought it was His looks were not quite friendly and I was so revolted at these constant changes that I could not forbear whispering So youve changed sides again
There was no time left for him to answer in The buccaneers with oaths and cries began to leap one after another into the pit and to dig with their fingers throwing the boards aside as they did so Morgan found a piece of gold He held it up with a perfect spout of oaths It was a two-guinea piece and it went from hand to hand among them for a quarter of a minute
Two guineas roared Merry shaking it at Silver Thats your seven hundred thousand pounds is it Youre the man for bargains aint you Youre him that never bungled nothing you wooden-headed lubber
Dig away boys said Silver with the coolest insolence youll find some pig-nuts and I shouldnt wonder
Pig-nuts repeated Merry in a scream Mates do you hear that I tell you now that man there knew it all along Look in the face of him and youll see it wrote there
Ah Merry remarked Silver standing for capn again Youre a pushing lad to be sure
But this time everyone was entirely in Merrys favour They began to scramble out of the excavation darting furious glances behind them One thing I observed which looked well for us they all got out upon the opposite side from Silver
Well there we stood two on one side five on the other the pit between us and nobody screwed up high enough to offer the first blow Silver never moved he watched them very upright on his crutch and looked as cool as ever I saw him He was brave and no mistake
At last Merry seemed to think a speech might help matters
Mates says he theres two of them alone there ones the old cripple that brought us all here and blundered us down to this the others that cub that I mean to have the heart of Now mates
He was raising his arm and his voice and plainly meant to lead a charge But just thencrack crack crackthree musket-shots flashed out of the thicket Merry tumbled head foremost into the excavation the man with the bandage spun round like a teetotum and fell all his length upon his side where he lay dead but still twitching and the other three turned and ran for it with all their might
Before you could wink Long John had fired two barrels of a pistol into the struggling Merry and as the man rolled up his eyes at him in the last agony George said he I reckon I settled you
At the same moment the doctor Gray and Ben Gunn joined us with smoking muskets from among the nutmeg-trees
Forward cried the doctor Double quick my lads We must head em off the boats
And we set off at a great pace sometimes plunging through the bushes to the chest
I tell you but Silver was anxious to keep up with us The work that man went through leaping on his crutch till the muscles of his chest were fit to burst was work no sound man ever equalled and so thinks the doctor As it was he was already thirty yards behind us and on the verge of strangling when we reached the brow of the slope
Doctor he hailed see there No hurry
Sure enough there was no hurry In a more open part of the plateau we could see the three survivors still running in the same direction as they had started right for Mizzenmast Hill We were already between them and the boats and so we four sat down to breathe while Long John mopping his face came slowly up with us
Thank ye kindly doctor says he You came in in about the nick I guess for me and Hawkins And so its you Ben Gunn he added Well youre a nice one to be sure
Im Ben Gunn I am replied the maroon wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment And he added after a long pause how do Mr Silver Pretty well I thank ye says you
Ben Ben murmured Silver to think as youve done me
The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted in their flight by the mutineers and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying related in a few words what had taken place It was a story that profoundly interested Silver and Ben Gunn the half-idiot maroon was the hero from beginning to end
Ben in his long lonely wanderings about the island had found the skeletonit was he that had rifled it he had found the treasure he had dug it up it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation he had carried it on his back in many weary journeys from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA
When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted he had gone to Silver given him the chart which was now uselessgiven him the stores for Ben Gunns cave was well supplied with goats meat salted by himselfgiven anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money
As for you Jim he said it went against my heart but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty and if you were not one of these whose fault was it
That morning finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers he had run all the way to the cave and leaving the squire to guard the captain had taken Gray and the maroon and started making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine Soon however he saw that our party had the start of him and Ben Gunn being fleet of foot had been dispatched in front to do his best alone Then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates and he was so far successful that Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasure-hunters
Ah said Silver it were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here You would have let old John be cut to bits and never given it a thought doctor
Not a thought replied Dr Livesey cheerily
And by this time we had reached the gigs The doctor with the pick-axe demolished one of them and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for North Inlet
This was a run of eight or nine miles Silver though he was almost killed already with fatigue was set to an oar like the rest of us and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea Soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island round which four days ago we had towed the HISPANIOLA
As we passed the two-pointed hill we could see the black mouth of Ben Gunns cave and a figure standing by it leaning on a musket It was the squire and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers in which the voice of Silver joined as heartily as any
Three miles farther just inside the mouth of North Inlet what should we meet but the HISPANIOLA cruising by herself The last flood had lifted her and had there been much wind or a strong tide current as in the southern anchorage we should never have found her more or found her stranded beyond help As it was there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the main-sail Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water We all pulled round again to Rum Cove the nearest point for Ben Gunns treasure-house and then Gray single-handed returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA where he was to pass the night on guard
A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave At the top the squire met us To me he was cordial and kind saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise At Silvers polite salute he somewhat flushed
John Silver he said youre a prodigious villain and impostera monstrous imposter sir I am told I am not to prosecute you Well then I will not But the dead men sir hang about your neck like mill-stones
Thank you kindly sir replied Long John again saluting
I dare you to thank me cried the squire It is a gross dereliction of my duty Stand back
And thereupon we all entered the cave It was a large airy place with a little spring and a pool of clear water overhung with ferns The floor was sand Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett and in a far corner only duskily flickered over by the blaze I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold That was Flints treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA How many it had cost in the amassing what blood and sorrow what good ships scuttled on the deep what brave men walking the plank blindfold what shot of cannon what shame and lies and cruelty perhaps no man alive could tell Yet there were still three upon that islandSilver and old Morgan and Ben Gunnwho had each taken his share in these crimes as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward
Come in Jim said the captain Youre a good boy in your line Jim but I dont think you and mell go to sea again Youre too much of the born favourite for me Is that you John Silver What brings you here man
Come back to my dooty sir returned Silver
Ah said the captain and that was all he said
What a supper I had of it that night with all my friends around me and what a meal it was with Ben Gunns salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the HISPANIOLA Never I am sure were people gayer or happier And there was Silver sitting back almost out of the firelight but eating heartily prompt to spring forward when anything was wanted even joining quietly in our laughterthe same bland polite obsequious seaman of the voyage out
And Last
THE next morning we fell early to work for the transportation of this great mass of gold near a mile by land to the beach and thence three miles by boat to the HISPANIOLA was a considerable task for so small a number of workmen The three fellows still abroad upon the island did not greatly trouble us a single sentry on the shoulder of the hill was sufficient to ensure us against any sudden onslaught and we thought besides they had had more than enough of fighting
Therefore the work was pushed on briskly Gray and Ben Gunn came and went with the boat while the rest during their absences piled treasure on the beach Two of the bars slung in a ropes end made a good load for a grown manone that he was glad to walk slowly with For my part as I was not much use at carrying I was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into bread-bags
It was a strange collection like Billy Boness hoard for the diversity of coinage but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I never had more pleasure than in sorting them English French Spanish Portuguese Georges and Louises doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spiders web round pieces and square pieces and pieces bored through the middle as if to wear them round your necknearly every variety of money in the world must I think have found a place in that collection and for number I am sure they were like autumn leaves so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out
Day after day this work went on by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers
At lastI think it was on the third nightthe doctor and I were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle when from out the thick darkness below the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing It was only a snatch that reached our ears followed by the former silence
Heaven forgive them said the doctor tis the mutineers
All drunk sir struck in the voice of Silver from behind us
Silver I should say was allowed his entire liberty and in spite of daily rebuffs seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent Indeed it was remarkable how well he bore these slights and with what unwearying politeness he kept on trying to ingratiate himself with all Yet I think none treated him better than a dog unless it was Ben Gunn who was still terribly afraid of his old quartermaster or myself who had really something to thank him for although for that matter I suppose I had reason to think even worse of him than anybody else for I had seen him meditating a fresh treachery upon the plateau Accordingly it was pretty gruffly that the doctor answered him
Drunk or raving said he
Right you were sir replied Silver and precious little odds which to you and me
I suppose you would hardly ask me to call you a humane man returned the doctor with a sneer and so my feelings may surprise you Master Silver But if I were sure they were ravingas I am morally certain one at least of them is down with feverI should leave this camp and at whatever risk to my own carcass take them the assistance of my skill
Ask your pardon sir you would be very wrong quoth Silver You would lose your precious life and you may lay to that Im on your side now hand and glove and I shouldnt wish for to see the party weakened let alone yourself seeing as I know what I owes you But these men down there they couldnt keep their wordno not supposing they wished to and whats more they couldnt believe as you could
No said the doctor Youre the man to keep your word we know that
Well that was about the last news we had of the three pirates Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting A council was held and it was decided that we must desert them on the islandto the huge glee I must say of Ben Gunn and with the strong approval of Gray We left a good stock of powder and shot the bulk of the salt goat a few medicines and some other necessaries tools clothing a spare sail a fathom or two of rope and by the particular desire of the doctor a handsome present of tobacco
That was about our last doing on the island Before that we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress and at last one fine morning we weighed anchor which was about all that we could manage and stood out of North Inlet the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade
The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for as we soon had proved For coming through the narrows we had to lie very near the southern point and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand with their arms raised in supplication It went to all our hearts I think to leave them in that wretched state but we could not risk another mutiny and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness The doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left and where they were to find them But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us for Gods sake to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place
At last seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot one of themI know not which it wasleapt to his feet with a hoarse cry whipped his musket to his shoulder and sent a shot whistling over Silvers head and through the main-sail
After that we kept under cover of the bulwarks and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance That was at least the end of that and before noon to my inexpressible joy the highest rock of Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea
We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a handonly the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet We laid her head for the nearest port in Spanish America for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands and as it was what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales we were all worn out before we reached it
It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land-locked gulf and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money The sight of so many good-humoured faces especially the blacks the taste of the tropical fruits and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island and the doctor and the squire taking me along with them went ashore to pass the early part of the night Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war fell in talk with him went on board his ship and in short had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the HISPANIOLA
Ben Gunn was on deck alone and as soon as we came on board he began with wonderful contortions to make us a confession Silver was gone The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives which would certainly have been forfeit if that man with the one leg had stayed aboard But this was not all The sea-cook had not gone empty-handed He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas to help him on his further wanderings
I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him
Well to make a long story short we got a few hands on board made a good cruise home and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr Blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort Five men only of those who had sailed returned with her Drink and the devil had done for the rest with a vengeance although to be sure we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about
All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly according to our natures Captain Smollett is now retired from the sea Gray not only saved his money but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise also studied his profession and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship married besides and the father of a family As for Ben Gunn he got a thousand pounds which he spent or lost in three weeks or to be more exact in nineteen days for he was back begging on the twentieth Then he was given a lodge to keep exactly as he had feared upon the island and he still lives a great favourite though something of a butt with the country boys and a notable singer in church on Sundays and saints days
Of Silver we have heard no more That formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life but I dare say he met his old Negress and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint It is to be hoped so I suppose for his chances of comfort in another world are very small
The bar silver and the arms still lie for all that I know where Flint buried them and certainly they shall lie there for me Oxen and wain-ropes would not bring me back again to that accursed island and the worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about its coasts or start upright in bed with the sharp voice of Captain Flint still ringing in my ears Pieces of eight Pieces of eight

MARQUIS OF SALISBURY
MY LORD
To neglect any proper opportunity of testifying my devotion to your Lordship would be unjust unworthy and ungrateful therefore I only comply with the most manifest propriety in humbly soliciting your protection to this work
Yet my Lord though the propriety is strong though the task is indispensible though the subject warmly gratifies my best pride yet never was effort so uncommonly difficult—Great men have patronized public characters and the encouragement of genius has been in many instances the most brilliant distinction of English nobility but there is no example of such an act of beneficence as that which your Lordship has extended towards me No benefactor ever had the power to confer a favour of equal magnitude nor were those favours that have been conferred given from any such noble motive or independent principle
It was reserved for your Lordship to dignify patronage by blending solicitous condescension with spontaneous liberality
If then men of great and celebrated talents have found their thanks inadequate to inferior favours in attempting to describe the true colour of my acknowledgments how greatly must I fail who can express so little and who have been honoured so much
My sanctuary is in my mind No mans feelings can be more alive than mine are nor was there ever an occasion on which they were so sensibly or so worthily roused I humbly hope therefore your Lordship will in your goodness take my thanks upon trust and give me credit for that gratitude which glows in my heart but which no language can convey to my pen
With the truest zeal and most perfect devotion
I am My Lord Your Lordships Greatly honoured obliged And obedient servant C DIBDIN

PREFACE
THERE cannot be any thing  fallacious as the cavils of those authors who complain of being unjustly treated by the public The judgment of the public like those laws to which they owe their existence as a respected and a happy people—spight of the factious few whose impotent clamour serves as its shadow to display the light of reason—never fails to decide firmly yet indulgently and nothing can more completely confirm character and security than the dispassionate determination of the one and the unbiassed decision of the other
But though the judgment of the public and the laws of the land contain in themselves all we know of reason and equity yet nothing can be so difficult as to make a fair appeal to either The sons of chicane in both so clog up the course and so poison the air that the career is fatiguing and dangerous and thus many with fair pretensions turn back their pursuits and purposes unaccomplished and rather resign the honours of the race than strive to reach a delusive goal to obtain an unavailing victory
Perhaps the painter who had been ruined by going to law without bringing any thing to issue had these ideas in his mind when he drew a picture of justice supported by hunger and thirst
But I shall leave those laws which the prudence of our forefathers has established for the security of property—which are in this country a monument of sober reflection sound wisdom and solid judgment which are at this moment dispensed by men of brilliant talents correct information and invincible integrity and which are only inconvenient because they are abused inefficient because their essence is perverted and oppressive because they are held out as snares for the good and the worthy by the wicked and the worthless—and speak of those other laws which civilization has established for the security of fame and which being of a wider extent and without so decided a criterion are productive of much more sportive mischief than the others both because the scribbling pettifoggers have warmer imaginations than the legal ones and because their nefarious freaks though full as rascally may be exercised with impunity
According to this illicit lawyers—for I really ought to make this distinction—so they possess a plentiful stock of cunning and craft need not be overburdened with intellects but this is not the case with the other class Illicit writers cannot combat opinions without some stock of general information their competitors being men of abilities and thus it happens that as you may call a lawyer a dunce and welcome so you do not call him a rogue so you may call a scribbler a rogue and welcome so you do not call him a dunce which is like Footes stroke at a society who sometime ago set themselves up as reformers under the appellation of The Christian Club
Having talked of hanging and being told that such an insinuation would give offence for that a brother of one of the members had been hanged he changes his ground and talks of damning—
That is right says the other damn as much as you please for though the Christian club may have some fears of the gallows they do not value damnation of a brass farthing
The truth of this distinction which I have made will I think be pretty clearly established by a consideration that the traffic of the lawyers depends on certain things called goods chattles houses hereditaments—in short any thing that can be conveyed—whereas the scribblers cannot always convey the object of their traffic even in idea A lampoon is not attachable or if it were it would be of no value There is nothing tangible in a modern Pindaric ode or if there were as Shakespeare has it
Those that touch pitch will be defiled
Nor can poor Priscian bring his action of battery though we see his head broken every day
Thus while they steer clear of hitting the man they may discharge whole vollies of their pointless arrows at the writer with safety He has no objection to their picking up their crumbs at his expence The sun nurtures myriads of insects that at once inhale poison and preservation from his genial influence
As I certainly allude to the abuse with which in my life I have been so foully bespattered it should seem as if I had drawn this conclusion with a view to announce myself a man of genius Were I so weak I should be in a lamentable error indeed For an author with the smallest pretensions to fame I ought by this time to have been abused ten times more than I have unless indeed I rate the quality of the abuse in addition to the quantity and so by throwing one lump of invidious rascality into the scale make it preponderate in my favour
I am afraid however I am not so lucky for in this case I must take in the idea that the slander of a rogue is a compliment to an honest man and I have already said that every thing beyond literary defamation is here out of the question I have therefore nothing left for it but a comparative view of that abuse which has been levelled at others and myself and upon that enumeration I shall be driven to estimate my own labours at that humble rate which the public will always give its due praise but which aspires at nothing more
To begin with the ancients Has any writer sustained more rank and foul abuse than Homer who after all is so justly styled the father of poetry and if they began with the father no wonder they have so completely gone through all the family—It has been said that the muses themselves set him up a rival in Hesiod whom they invited to reside with them on Mount Helicon and that they might initiate him into all their mysteries actually took him into their service and endowed him with their own celestial genius Tutored thus by his heavenly instructresses he is said to have won a tripod from Homer at a poetical controversy at Chalcis but Alexander laughs at this business construing it into a compliment to Homer and saying that Hesiod might well win a prize from Homer when not kings but peasants were the judges
When you come to Virgil these candid reporters allow nothing more than that he was the translator and imitator of Homer to prove which they instance his sending Aeneas to hell in positive imitation of the Odyssey the conversation of the gods the games the ships and many other things But what sort of an imitator of Homer must he have been if it be true as Le Mercier informs us that Homer wrote neither the Iliad nor the Odyssey—but that they were compiled from the works of all the eminent writers of that time impressing very strongly an idea that Homer was merely a ballad singer and that he invented nothing but only promulgated the Grub-street doctrine of Greece
It is said also that Virgil imitated Hesiod in his georgics and Theocritus in his pastorals Terrence too is said to have been no more than the translator of Plautus Livy the imitator of Herodotus and Sallust of Thucidides who had before been imitated in his writings—which after all were obscure—by Zenephon and in his orations by Demosthenes Horace they report stole his art of poetry from Aristotles rhetoric and as to Aristotle himself some have gone so far as to question whether we have any thing genuine of his at all and they offer the following circumstance as a notable proof of this vague and strange opinion
Theophrastus received as a legacy the writings of Aristotle The heirs of Theophrastus buried them in the ground at Scepsis a town of Troas to hide them from King Pergamus Here they lay concealed a hundred and sixty years and were at the end of that time sold to one Appellicon a rich citizen of Athens They fell afterwards into the hands of Sylla after that they were possessed by Tyrannian a grammarian and next they became the property of Andronicus of Rhodes who first made them public about two hundred and fifty years after the death of Aristotle
Thus we have a Virgil who imitated a Homer who never was a writer—and we have a Horace who stole from the works of an Aristotle which works it is insinuated are spurious But neither is Zoilus himself of Philadelphus nor Le Mercier the Zoilus of France to be put in the smallest competition with Father Ardouine who determined to put the matter out of doubt roundly asserts upon his own single authority that Homer Virgil and Horace were all forged by monks in the twelfth century Perhaps it was upon some occasion like this that Pascal said it was easier to find monks than reasons
Thus go on these Aristarchuses in criticism The defenders of Virgil assuming great candour tell us that they subscribe to those charges brought against him above mentioned but that he certainly excelled Hesiod Justice however obliges them to confess that he fell short of Theocritus in the same proportion as the Latin is inferior to the Greek They confess too that he stole from Lucretius but this they add was a proof of his esteem for him They then candidly hint that it was little better than receiving stolen goods for that Lucretius himself is suspected of having taken some of his works from Empedocles and others and yet in the same breath they say that Lucretius ranks before all other Latin authors They defend Virgil from a charge that Lucan was a greater poet combating the opinions of Heinsius Corneille Heron and Fielding who all give the palm to Lucan but to make this defence as left-handed as possible they allow that the Pharsalia is more complete than the Aeneid because there is a fault in the chronology which anacronism however to gloss over they insist that Virgil intended it as a beauty and then follow up this cold compliment by saying that Lucan though an original was an original of no value The deduction therefore is that it is doubtful whether Virgil was not a worse poet than Lucan who after all has no great merit himself But a modern critic has gone a great deal beyond this asserting that though the whole reputation of Virgil stands upon three specimens of imitation though he has no invention no originality no creation yet he deserves all his fame—and how does he make this out Why truly by attributing this fame to his style which he calls the
pickle that has preserved his mummy from corruption
Were I to advert to the long catalogue of opposite opinions which will very easily occur to any man of reading who has a faithful and retentive memory it would be an intrusion on the patience of every intelligent reader I have instanced abundantly enough to prove that cavillers find it difficult to convince that Envy beholds pigmy imperfections and neglects giant beauties and that fools in search of defects and contradictions deprive themselves of that pleasure and improvement with which heaven permits men of superior talents to adorn the world
It is with me a matter of infinite concern that if candour be the criterion of genius the ancients possessed more genius than the moderns When Euripides died Sophocles went into mourning and yet to prove that Sophocles was fond of applause he died with joy at the success of one of his own tragedies What can be more noble than the declaration of Theodore Gaza that if all the works then extant were to be thrown into the sea the last that would merit such a fate would be the works of Plutarch Or the forbearance of Zenophon who might have had the writings of Thucidides attributed to him but he disdained it
If the cotemporaries of Terence acknowledge that he has imitated Plautus they never fail to add that it was making gold out of dross By one it was said that the very prostitutes of Terence speak with more modesty than the honest women of Plautus Cicero speaking of the purity of Terence calls him the regulator of the Latin tongue Alexander when he sacked Thebes spared the house and posterity of Pindar Plato was called the divine Zenophon from his sweetness and beauty is called the bee and the attic muse His works are said to have inspired Scipio the African and Lucullus in like manner as those of Homer fired the mind of Alexander
When do we hear in these times such warmth and candour as that of Appolonius Molus who on hearing Cicero harrangue exclaimed—
Poor Greece Now thou art utterly undone—The Romans had before conquered thee in arms now they have conquered thee in eloquence
These few instances among many that occur to me prove that the ancients possessed every merit that has been attributed to them and shew that the greatest effort of the human mind is to rise superior to envy
The influence of this fiend however lay only dormant till the inestimable works of these great men were universally diffused The moment that opportunity occurred she shook off her torpor awoke walked abroad and looked so terrible that modest reason sighed blushed and retired
To be plain It is remarkable that the more modern we get the more the number of cavillers increases and really as cavilling is a very ungracious thing this is lucky for them both because the task becomes every day more and more difficult and because the dunces become every day more and more stupid Thus the labour by being given into so many hands is infinitely less tremendous
The quantum of abuse must be always the same and how hard it is to fall to the lot of one man wholly to employ himself in searching out the faults of his neighbour when by an honest appropriation of his time he might manifest some perfection of his own This feat of hardihood however we see Milbourn almost single-handed attempt against Dryden though the portion of abuse is as great and the quality as malevolent as all that vast cargo of Grub-street filth with which Pope was bespattered by all the heroes immortalized in the Dunciad and if we want a climax we have nothing to do but look at that flock of critical crows who even yet have not left off gorging on the literary carcase of Doctor Johnson
But if I were to go into that large field of observation which it would be necessary to traverse to get at the divers schisms that have at times distracted the state of literature I should make it the field of battle between the moderns and the ancients In France I should set Corneille and Racine against Sophocles and Euripides Malherbe against Pindar Moliere against Menander and Aristophanes nay Plautus and Terence The Countess De la Suse and Madame Dacier would pull caps with Sapho In Italy Petrarch and Guarini would attack Ovid and Tibullus Tasso would menace to their teeth Homer and Virgil Camoes Lopez de Vega Calderone and Cervantes would single out their respective antagonists for the honour of Spain and Portugal and I should involve literature in that chaos of prejudices and opinions from which men of the best learning find it so extremely difficult to separate its constituent parts
Did I extend the scene to England instead of the preface to a work I must necessarily make this a work of itself So many so extraordinary so vague so diversified have been the real or affected opinions in this country as to what constitutes the essence of literary perfection that you have only to transmute them as you ring changes upon bells and every English writer at different times has and has not possessed it
I shall therefore by way of corroborating my assertion that no man is entitled to any large portion of literary fame till he has been handsomely abused only instance some of that prodigious load of foul and slanderous filth which—as good sometimes grows out of evil—procured the world those two monuments of genius and justice Mac Flecnoe and the Dunciad and I the more readily do this to shew that one specimen is as good as a thousand because were I to produce a thousand nothing could be said in them but what is already said here nay nor even in one of these that is not said in the other
Milbourn as I before mentioned is the author of nearly all the calumny against Dryden—Popes calumniators are Dennis Theobald Oldmixon and a variety of others who one should think were more than adequate to the task for they had nothing to do but copy what had been written before Dryden upon this single and Pope upon this complicate authority are every thing that can be said of the worst men and the worst writers
Dryden is a mere renegado from monarchy poetry and good sense
Pope is an open enemy to his country and the commonwealth of learning
Dryden is a true republican son of a monarchical church and a republican atheist
Pope is both a roman-catholic whig and a protestant tory
Dryden has notoriously traduced the king the queen the lords the gentlemen and libelled the whole nation and its representatives—
Pope has abused the persons of the king the queen both houses of parliament the privy council the bench of bishops the established church and the ministry
Dryden looks upon Gods gospel as a foolish fable like the pope to whom he is a pitiful purveyor His very christianity may be questioned He ought to expect more severity than other men as he is more unmerciful in his reflections on others With as good a right as his holiness he sets up for poetical infallibility
Pope is a popish rhymester bred up with a contempt of the sacred writings His religion allows him to destroy heretics not only with his pen but with fire and sword and such were all those unhappy wits whom he sacrificed to his accursed popish principles It deserved vengeance to suggest that Mr Pope has less infallibility than his namesake at Rome
Drydens libel meaning Mac Flecknoe is all bad matter beautiful which is all that can be said of it with good metre Mr Drydens genius did not appear in any thing more than his versification and whether he is to be ennobled for that only is a question
Popes smooth numbers in the Dunciad are all that recommend it nor has it any other merit It must be owned he has got a notable knack of rhyming and writing smooth verse
Drydens Virgil is so called to shew it is not that Virgil so admired in the Augustan age but a Virgil of another stamp a silly impertinent nonsensical writer None but a Bavius a Maevius or a Bathyllus carped at Virgil and none but such unthinking vermine admire his translator
Popes Homer does not talk like Homer but like Pope and he who translated him one would swear had a hill in Tiperary for his Parnassus and a puddle in some bog for his Hypocrene He has no admirers among those who can distinguish discern and judge
Dryden deserves to be whipt for his ignorance of Greek
Pope undertook to translate Homer from the Greek of which he knows not one word into English of which he understands as little
Dryden imposed upon his subscribers by holding out a partially and unseasonably celebrated name which imposition extended even to the picking of their pockets
Popes subscribers have been deceived in their expectations in proportion as he has drained their pockets
The epithets which have been bestowed on these great men are still more curious Milbourn thus calls Dryden an ape
A crafty ape dressed in a gaudy gown Whips put into an apes paw to play pranks with None but apish and papish brats will heed him
Dennis is just as kind to Pope
Let us take says he the initial letter of his christian name and the initial and final letters of his surname viz A P E and they give you the same idea of an ape as his face
Dryden according to Milbourn is also an ass
A camel says he will take upon him no more burden than is sufficient for his strength but there is another beast that crouches under all
Pope is ingeniously paid the same compliment by Dennis
It is my duty says he to pull off the lions skin from this little ass
Dryden is after this a frog
Poet Squab says Milbourn endued with Poet Maroes spirit an ugly croaking kind of vermine which would swell to the bulk of an ox
Dennis imitating his preceptor says almost the same thing of Pope
A squab short gentleman a little creature that like the frog in the fable swells and is angry that it is not allowed to be as big as an ox
Dryden is after this and so is Pope a knave a coward a fool and a thing which indeed—if a pun may be pardoned—seems the only thing left for them to say
If then ignorance imposition cowardice knavery profligacy irreligion and treason are requisite attributes to establish the same of Dryden and Pope
why what a vile and peasant slave am I
My calumniators have gone but a very little way indeed towards ascertaining my merit by this criterion I beg therefore they will bestir themselves and as in this novel I have given them new opportunity—especially as they may find in it a mirror that will reflect some of their own faces—I assure them they cannot afford me a more sensible pleasure than to avail themselves of it as usual unawed by truth candour or consistency
Having indubitably proved that it is my interest to be abused I shall now for the advantage of those who though they intend enmity confer kindness shew in what way it may best or rather most expediently be done
First I would have them keep no sort of measures but indulge their rancour as much as possible Let their method be to hold such trifles as probability propriety and decency in contempt to use perpetually epithets which are appropriate to rage disappointment and vexation to enforce terms that imply candour ingenuousness and liberality—Thus in proportion as they are bursting with envy so at least in their own opinions they will conceal it like the silly bird that thrusts its head into a hedge to hide its body from its pursuers
If they would detect nonsense I would have them write nonsense themselves because this will shew practically what it is Ignorance of their subject is a good thing because it serves to exercise the ingenuity of the reader Ill manners is not amiss for it often bullies the reader into a fancied comprehension of what in reality is incomprehensible
I would have all their outworks of criticism fortified with threats denunciations and menaces I would have these supported by impudence arrogance and cruelty I would have them place about fascines of hints insinuations and conjectures and when by a powerful onset of truth and conviction they were driven from these I would have them take shelter in their strong hold of
ipse dixit
that anticipater of argument that reconciler of absurdity that friend of ignorance that vehicle of malevolence that poisoned arrow that coiled snake that baneful flower that smiling precipice
Ipse dixit—
the skulking retreat of the shuffler the hypocrite the villain the traitor and the rascal
Ipse dixit—
that shall blast the faith of honour that shall fully the purity of virtue that shall pervert truth sanctify mischief emulate murder annihilate order reprobate morality dignify sacrilege profane the throne and defy heaven
Let them utter
ipse dixits
then like so many fiats but never let them presume to argue lest detected by ignorance forsaken by truth and exposed to scorn they betray frontless impudence and scowling envy hidden by a filmy veil of candour
There are some subjects however with which I would not advise them to tamper In particular let them not risk the awkward predicament in which they would stand if they were hardy enough to censure the public for the warm and liberal reception afforded to my labours Let them not venture to slander those men of worth and honour who approve in me in opposition to them a life of regularity sobriety and industry and above all as it is impossible for human invention—not even their invention—to give any other motive to the honourable and generous support by which I have the happiness to be distinguished by that nobleman who presides over public amusements than unexampled and transcendant benevolence let them instead of attempting to describe it scowl bite their malignant quills gnash their teeth and hang their recreant heads in sullenness and despair
With these instructions I think they can hardly miss their way If there should be any danger of it—as it would be a pity that such charitable intentions should reap nothing but shame and confusion—by way of consummating their noble and manly purpose let them boldly assert that I have written none of this book Let them be so ungratefully severe as to say it is not I who have given them this friendly advice but some outcast from society and as novelty in slander is as catching as in any thing else—having gone every other length—suppose this time by way of variety it were to be attributed to some murderer I think as Mr Bayes has it the circumstance would elevate and surprise But this after all I leave to themselves for it is impossible I should be an adept in an employ the motives of which I scorn and the malignity of which I detest
If by officiously pointing out their readiest road it should appear to them that I have by anticipation betrayed the cloven foot and they should be therefore induced to forego their intentions from an apprehension of detection—for assassins are always cowards—let it be remembered that I shall set it down for a sulky perverseness and even though no single word of abuse shall be breathed against me I shall take very comfortably to myself the same portion of fame as if such advantageous circumstance had really happened and set it down with all the composure in the world as a large figure to go towards that aggregate of slander which I have so plainly shewn is necessary to constitute the fame of a writer and which upon that ground of argument I am so ambitious to merit
Having gone through the painful part of my duty—for there is nothing so painful as that which is unavailing and there is nothing so unavailing as giving advice to the incorrigible—a few words will bring me to the end of this preface A few very pleasing words They are these that in this as in every other instance where I have offered any production to the public having portrayed vice in its ugliest form and filthiest colours having hunted craft and art to the toils having invited the broad laugh against vain and insuperable folly having excited the admiration and commended the practice of virtue and honour I fearlessly trust my book to its fortune safe in the criticism of the candid and secure in the indulgence of the liberal for the moral I inculcate is the folly of wickedness and the wisdom of rectitude a doctrine which shews that while irritated vice multiplies deformity by breaking the mirror of nature it remains entire and unfullied to the eye of virtue that consciously reflects its own unspotted loveliness
THE YOUNGER BROTHER
BOOK I
CONTAINING MORE INCIDENTAL MATTER THAN IS GENERALLY COMPRISED IN SEVERAL VOLUMES—YET LESS THAN ANY BOOK IN THIS HISTORY
CHAPTER I
SHEWS UPON WHAT GROUNDS THE AUTHOR FOUNDS HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE READERS INDULGENCE
As it very often happens that readers get half through a work without knowing its drift—not unfrequently because the author does not know it himself—I hold it necessary to preclude all possibility of any such thing in the perusal of this work by premising what according to my conception ought to be the tendency of productions similar to this and what I here mean to inculcate in particular
A novel as the word is now understood and established is a general title for any work which springs solely from the imagination yet so delineates men and manners as to place all its events within view of probability It is a kind of mean betwixt history which records mere fact and romance which holds out acknowledged fiction
As however pleasure and instruction are the only end that any admitted exercise of the imagination can propose these all labour with different materials to produce the same effect History not only teaches mankind to shun vice and imitate virtue by instancing those events which are most condusive to so laudable an end but shews the propriety of the doctrine it enforces by authenticating the possibility of such conduct
The novelist who is the biographer of an imaginary hero chuses for his source manners in general His margin cannot swell with authorities nor can he—by way of notes—cite the contrary opinions of great men concerning the vices or virtues of those characters he celebrates So they possess the same qualities in common with the rest of mankind and the events brought about by their means are such as our observation points out to be natural his task is completely performed and he has a right to expect as much credit for relating circumstances that might have happened as he who—as far as he can clear his narrative from the cobwebs of tradition and disentangle it from the labyrinth of contradictory authority—records facts that did happen
Romances are figuratively in nature and literally fictitious They are intended by lifting the mind above probability to enforce moral by figure and allegory and they attain their end—and indeed laudably—for they rouse those torpid minds into action which cannot relish writings that are kept within the bounds of simple nature
This species of composition is remarkably gratifying to weak minds It is—if I may be permitted so to express myself—an honourable fraud for exaggerate the beauty of virtue how you can it will still be lovely whereas vice being ugly in itself becomes more hideous when it is caricatured
These three different vehicles for the conveyance of truth and morality seem to require different conductors and indeed it has seldom happened that any one man has equally succeeded in them—Romance seems to require a poetic soul strong in conception fertile in invention and various in expression History wants nothing but a perspicuous style authentic information and invincible veracity
He who writes novels must partake of all these qualities He must unite in his imagination the glow of poetry with the steadiness of narrative—The latter must be as a curb to the former not however to damp its spirit but to prevent it from running away—like the alderman who at a lord mayors feast would have made himself sick if his physician had not sat by the side of him
Thus I think it becomes pretty evident that novel writing holds a very respectable stand in literature and I sincerely believe that men of considerable talents would very often practise it were it not for those spurious productions with which the press teems under the appellation of novels which means any love story calculated to madden the minds of sentimental country ladies to trouble the domestic happiness of old gentlemen who marry young girls and to overturn the purity imbibed at boarding schools
These are sure to make their way into all the circulating libraries in the kingdom provided they are sufficiently stuffed with dying lovers inexorable parents and impertinent chambermaids with the addition of three or four elopements half a dozen duels and an attempt or two at a rape to which may be added a little suicide or a smattering of incest—especially if it be written by a lady—by way of zest to make it go down the more glib
Being about to give a novel to the world I thought it incumbent on me to say thus much from which the reader will naturally conclude that I intend throughout this work to keep nature and probability in sight to reject that which is frivolous and impertinent and to adopt only what by means of amusement may bring about instruction
It will nevertheless be necessary to say further that in portraying nature I shall make her neither a flattering likeness nor a caricature Nor is it necessary for let her sit for her picture ever so often she never will exhibit the same face twice yet shall the general resemblance always be striking for it has been well observed that she takes every various hue of the camelion yet torture her how you will her form is as constant as the polypus No two human faces though composed of the same features ever were known to be correctly alike and the luminous mind of LAVATER did he attempt the arduous and absurd task of searching for any such would exactly resemble the lanthorn of AESOP
To these general remarks—which I conceived it expedient to place here—I shall add particular ones whenever they appear to be necessary and now I invite the reader to the examination of a faithful though a bold representation of human life for I declare upon my word as a man there is not a character or circumstance in this whole work which I do not experimentally know from a close observation and mankind to have virtual existence
CHAPTER II
CONTAINS A DESCRIPTION—TWO HOUSES—A CITIZEN—AND A REFLECTION UPON DEATH
A BRIDGE thrown over the high road at the entrance of a village in Warwickshire called Castlewick is the separation of two estates one of which had been at the period this history commences for half a century in the possession of the family of Hazard and the other for almost treble that space in the family of Roebuck
Nature had been equally bountiful in the distribution of her favours on either side of the road which fortuitous advantage art had been industriously called in to improve If a neat hamlet and a white spire gave a more modern termination to the view through a group of pines and cedars from Hazard lawn an old market town and a contiguous mouldering castle became visible through an avenue of elms from Roebuck park
Every Chinese temple urn or statue on one side erected to fancy consecrated to friendship or dedicated to the arts had on the other its rival grotto cavern or hermitage Here was seen a clump of elms there a row of oaks while the meandering avon—lest the lord of one mansion should be jealous of its favours lavished on the other—not only by the advantage of a distant height plunged up a rocky cliff to delight one favourite with the awful concussion of a beautiful cascade which falling lessened into a gurgling rivulet but also opening its smooth capacious bosom moved on in majestic silence through the possessions of the other stretching out on one side a small irregular stream which supplied the house watered the garden and turned the village mill
Old Rust the grandfather of Lord Hazard was a skinner in the city His profession unluckily made him rather a bye-word for he had such a voracious thirst or hunger after money—for gold can be both eaten and drank—that it was archly said he would skin any thing for profit Nay some are of opinion that from this very remark originated the epithet skinflint Be that as it may he certainly amassed a very large fortune and having run through the regular progression of livery-man common council-man deputy alderman sheriff and lord mayor he married in his seventy-first year a girl of sixteen without a sixpence who bore him—or somebody else—a son portioned three of her sisters granted a pension to an Irish relation set up a coach and bought a villa till at length having expostulated stormed threatened prayed and entreated to no purpose poor Rust—think of it with horror ye antiquated Adonises—died raving mad in St Lukes hospital
Previous to his insanity however he took care to make a will vesting his whole possessions in the hands of trustees for the use of his son His remains were therefore scarcely laid in the earth when the widow with a moderate annuity was obliged to sink into retirement and of her it will not be necessary to say more than that she died when her son who was purposely kept from her by his guardians came to be eighteen years old
Young Rust besides the possession of uncommon talents was wonderfully calculated for commerce Before he was thirty he considerably augmented his deceased fathers wealth and a few years afterwards—having bought a large estate which gave him the entire nomination of four members of parliament—he became so material an object to the minister that he was made one of those peers which it was then expedient to create lest the balance of power in the constitution should be found to lean too much to the side of the people
No longer Mr Rust then but Baron Hazard he pulled down the old mansion on the estate he had purchased and built that very chateau we have already commemorated As he had a towering ambition he now married into an honourable family not overburdened with riches was shortly blest with several children and had made some rapid strides towards an improvement in both church and state but—so transitory is the felicity of lords as well as inferior beings—he did not live long to enjoy that success his hopes seemed to promise—for sitting up a whole night to compose a speech which was to have introduced a plan to destroy pluralities and root out corruption he caught a cold which being followed by a fever he was hurried out of the world having scarcely time to settle his affairs
The young lord—but here kind reader let us both give a sigh to the memory of Lord Hazard and admire that the wisest designs in this sublunary existence are liable like a grain of sand to be scattered at the will of providence
CHAPTER III
CONTAINING ONE APPEAL TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS—AND ANOTHER TO THE READER
THE young lord—for we shall have no occasion for the rest of the family—saw himself his own master at a very early period of life a circumstance which together with dissipated company at the university and a profligate tutor contributed to form in him the strongest principles of debauchery and libertinism
When he became of age his licentiousness made him the terror of the neighbourhood It is true he was a little checked in his wild career by the wise and wholesome counsels of his mother to which he at first affected to listen but becoming more and more hardened her precepts and conduct were altogether disregarded till at length worn out with preaching to no purpose she retired into the bosom of her own family with a firm determination to consider herself entirely alienated from her disgracious son
Lord Hazard being now left to the unbridled influence of his headstrong passions stopt at nothing to gratify them The farmers wives and daughters if they had the smallest pretensions to beauty were sure to become objects first of his generosity then his gratification and afterwards his neglect or if they durst dispute his impetuous wishes his unalterable resentment But as the swiftest cannon ball which neither edifices of wood nor stone can oppose may be stopt in its very strongest velocity by the dull resistance of a wool pack so were the vehement pursuits of Lord Hazard effectually checked by that dullest of all dull things according to the bachelors—ay and many of the married men too—a wife
My lords tutor whose name was Viney and who as I hinted before had the highest ascendancy over his pupil—having ever been cnofiderably more useful to him in the conduct of his love affairs than in his study of the classics—had also another pupil Indeed his attention to this last mentioned scholar on whom he had expended a large part of that money which the bounty to Lord Hazard—for his lordship was liberal to excess—had lavished on him would appear very enigmatical did we not derive it from its natural motive
This scholar then was no other than his sister who without a penny had married an Irish fortune hunter and was very shortly saved the trouble of breaking his heart by a kind friend of his who killed him in a duel Viney had connived at this marriage which soon after it was consummated was found to be a mutual bite However as his sister was left a blooming widow of twenty-two he easily comforted himself by considering her market as not yet over In a word he had long in idea married her to Lord Hazard This will account for his generosity nor when it is considered how completely this same Mr Viney ruled his pupil will it appear very unaccountable that the lady should become at length in reality what she had long been in imagination
Marriage stopt for a while the excesses of Lord Hazard He doated on his wife and having taken this step Viney became his privy counsellor in a stronger degree than ever His tone however was soon changed He found her a mixture of arrogance meanness bridled wantonness and ignorant affectation Nor is it difficult to divine where it might have ended if he had not accidentally discovered after having been about three months blessed with an heir that she had an intrigue with his valet de chamber
This roused him at once She was properly detected the necessary steps were taken and a divorce obtained She recriminated indeed but he was a lord and his success certain Thus having received satisfaction for the injuries he had sustained he legally banished her for ever from his presence granting her only a decent provision for life
Any one experienced in the human heart will easily see the part Viney took upon his sisters detection He exclaimed against her with the greatest violence and was the forwardest in procuring his lordship that redress which he knew it was not in his power to prevent
This conduct established him more firmly than ever in the good graces and household of Lord Hazard the first of which advantages he often declared—loudly to the world—was the ultimate end of all his wishes because said he—softly to himself—it brings about the other
I have already shewn that marriage proved a pretty tight curb to the excesses of this young nobleman and one would think his divorce had given him a reasonable surfeit of marriage but I know not how it is some men seem to be the bubble of their own arts their whole study is to overreach themselves and if they stumble on tolerable content it is because things take a different turn from what they designed
Thus it happened with our peer Every resolution he took in consequence of being a widower was wrong and yet he hit upon happiness when he only meant revenge
This was his argument He had married a woman of spirit who had injured him in the strongest degree and for this indignity he was determined to take vengeance on her whole sex idly forgetting that this was revenging himself on a whole hive for the sting of a single bee Besides he himself was to blame the fault lay in his own want of discernment Had he fairly examined the ground of the business he would have plainly seen that it originated with Viney who had taught him nothing but what disgraced his birth and deprived him of the use of that valuable goodness of heart which he really possessed and which had he fallen into proper hands might have induced him to have dispensed the gifts of fortune nobly instead of licentiously
To put this worthy project in execution Lord Hazard resolved once more to try the married state resolutely vowing to conduct himself in so authoritative a manner to his second wife that she should not dare even to think without his previous permission He had scarcely come to this resolution but his uneasiness on his late disgrace vanished He looked round for a wife with the greatest eagerness till at length with Vineys assistance who was still consulted he thought he had found one to his wish
But how was he astonished when he plainly saw it would be impossible to avail himself of any one of those prudent determinations those ingenious precautions he had been so long and so industriously arming himself with He had now such a wife that to controul her was impossible to advise her useless
If my readers think he was again caught after so much wary and cautious resolution after such anticipation of success I hope it will be confessed he deserved it
Certainly he was disappointed but in that satisfactory way that a man would be at finding a lawyer who taking a brief should refuse a fee Lady Hazard could not be controuled advised or entreated for she had so high a sense of her duty such equanimity of temper and such sweetness of manners that she anticipated her lords very wishes He had received her from her father a wealthy country neighbour who wanted to aggrandize his family The young lady who had all her life made it her study to please her father found it no irksome task to watch and comply with the tempers of her husband—so true it is that a dutiful daughter has gone a great way towards becoming a good wife
If ever an extraordinary event new moulded a mans mind this unexpected merit in his wife had that effect on Lord Hazard He saw in an instant that his whole life had been one delusion that while he had sought for pleasure he had neglected happiness and therefore resolved doubly to cherish it since it had complacently condescended to come home to him
Nobody had ever dared to tell him he was a dupe to Viney he now saw it himself He did not however think proper to withdraw his protection from him but contented himself only with giving him a handsome rectory to which that worthy incumbent shortly removed
In about a twelvemonth after this second marriage—but hold all great events should be ushered in with cautious preparation
A watchmaker would have called the circumstance I am about to celebrate the main spring of this history a sailor would have said it was its helm and an alderman its marrow
It is something therefore of material consequence and of course proper to be given in a new chapter and with a particular introduction—all which ceremony though it may be the limbs and outward flourishes of writing is not without its use and though more than PHEDRUS have said that a tree should be estimated by its fruit and not by its leaves yet it must be considered that without the proper shelter afforded by the leaves no fruit could arrive to perfection
CHAPTER IV
WHICH—FIRST ADJUSTING A VERY ABSTRUSE DOGMA IN LITERATURE—INTRODUCES THE HERO TO THE READER
IT falls out sometimes at the theatre that at the very moment the audience are sitting with expectation on its utmost stretch an actor with a woe-begone countenance comes on the stage to announce the indisposition of the principal actress
This once happened of Desdemona and as there was no lady in the company competent to the part but her whose name was in the bills a gentleman undertook it at a very short warning The spectators were as usual content per force but after waiting a considerable time the apologizer was a second time obliged to come on who assured the audience the play would soon begin but at present Desdemona was not shaved
I hope it will not be thought by mentioning this case in point that I mean to introduce in a ludicrous way a matter of such eminent importance as that I now take the liberty of presenting to the readers notice but my
amour propre
is wounded for being forced—at the very critical moment I considered myself happy beyond all example in the mode of introducing my hero—to stopt short and put my readers in the exact situation of the spectators above described I am obliged to exculpate myself from any intentional offence by fairly laying the truth before them and humbly appealing to their candour or—according to the language of the standing theatrical apology—their usual indulgence
I was going to begin this chapter in a most lovely style by saying that the bees came about somebodys cradle and left their honey on his lips giving proof that he would be sweet and eloquent in discourse But casting in my mind who this somebody could be it presently struck me—for I
do bear a brain
—that the point was not settled
This prodigy is related of ST AMBROSE of Milan Doctor JOHNSON who ought to have known something about the matter says it was PINDAR but FENELON affirms it was said of PLATO by his preceptor SENECA who while the circumstance was warm in his mind dreamt that a cygnet flew to his bosom which by degrees became covered with feathers of a most beautiful and dazzling whiteness and which taking wing flew with a force and rapidity superior to an eagle—and these prodigies were so strongly verified in this great man that CICERO said of him when he grew up
If JUPITER had condescended to speak like man he would have used the language of PLATO
Now it cannot be denied but that here is proof upon proof on the side of FENELON and as he gathered this intelligence for the improvement of princes one would think that he must have made a point of collecting his materials from the best authorities But as there is no court of criticism to appeal to from the fiat of Dr JOHNSON—his
ipse dixit
being always final upon these occasions—if the reader please it shall stand for PINDAR not for the living PINDAR because every body knows that instead of honey he deals in nothing but gall
In this case it is melancholy to lose the beautiful dream of SENECA and the fine saying of CICERO but ornament and flourish must give way to truth and Dr JOHNSON Besides Mr BOSWELL informs us that the Doctor had but a pitiful opinion of FENELON for that he would not allow Telemachus to be written more than
pretty well
Having established this important point I shall regularly proceed to the business of introducing my hero who having set the poets together by the ears before he was born will be allowed to have given a pretty good specimen of the work he was to cut out for them afterwards
Many and various are the portents and omens that are said to have announced the births deaths and marriages of great men and women and I could muster up a long catalogue of them from the lady who made so handsome a deluge as to swallow up all Asia to Tom Thumb—which is a pretty touch of the bathos—who was swallowed up by a cow but that it would insensibly draw me into an imitation of certain authors who are fonder of shewing their reading than their good manners
I shall be forgiven however since a great man and a prodigy are almost synonimous terms if I lament that nature did not go a single step out of her road to introduce our hero neither his father nor his mother having dreamt any thing prodigious on the occasion
Viney indeed had a confused idea in a dream of a basilisk which kept continually in his way and the nurse as she nodded by the fire side while Lady Hazard was in labour dreamt that her young master— for she always said it would be a boy—spoke the moment he came into the world and that he believed any thing you said to him which she sagaciously interpreted as a sure sign that he would be very learned and very much imposed upon—the truth of which observation the reader may perhaps have occasion to admire before he and I part
Lady Hazards being brought to bed of a son to the great joy of that honourable family seems then to be the event I hinted at in the third chapter It really took place about a twelve month after the marriage and three years and a quarter—for I love to be exact—after the birth of the first son whom Lord Hazard called Zekiel after his grandfather and this our hero Charles after himself
The happiness of Lord Hazard would now have been complete had it not been imbittered by a consideration that the whole estate being willed away with the title he could not do his youngest son the justice he wished To amend however this deficiency he resolved to make him a paragon of learning and as he knew very well that had not the former part of his own life been devoted to idleness it would have been less given to dissipation he resolved to add a complete study of the arts to his sons education
In the contemplation of this plan he took great delight At length when Zekiel had attained his eleventh year he was sent to Eaton school to leave the coast clear for a proper attention to the education of Charles which his lordship was determined to superintend himself
Many essays were made upon his tender intellects which gave very promising hopes and now the difficulty was to get him a tutor Lord Hazard fairly owned he despaired of finding one to his wish He declared he had himself witnessed so much ill conduct in men of that description that he should be very cautious indeed how he made a choice
These doubts he often imparted to Lady Hazard who said she had mixed very little in the world and therefore was happy whenever he was so good as to give her his opinion in order that she might form hers She could not help thinking however that he was warmer on that subject than he otherwise would have been had not an ill choice been made in a tutor for him She hoped he would be able to find a man who should have talents and yet be honest
If said my lord I could form a tutor he should be ingenuous above all things not ashamed if he found any of those trivial vices creeping on him to which human nature is subject to confess and amend them Such a kind of man cannot design to do ill because he is sorry for his own infirmity Ingenuousness has a tendency to gratitude which is with me the first of virtues I declare if I was obliged to accuse a man of a crime and he could prove his motive to be in the smallest degree similar to any thing I had ever forgiven in myself I should instantly feel an inclination to pardon him It is the sneaking underhand villain I hate the hypocrite the deceiver who studies to be a rascal who stings while he fawns But he who acts from mere intuitive principles may correct his frailty by his judgment and at any rate you have a declared enemy and know how to be on your guard One stands some chance with a lion but who can provide against the venom of a slow worm
Thus ended a conversation which the reader may hereafter think I had a reason for inserting
Very little passed in this family worthy relation till Master Charles was twelve years old when one day my lord brought a gentleman who he said answered in every particular that description of person he had so long and so fruitlessly sought for as a tutor for his darling son As to Zekiel he did not believe him to be his son at all though he had in vain tried to prove him legally illegitimate He therefore took very little further notice of him than to remit him money nor did he express either astonishment or dissatisfaction at being told he was both an arrant dunce and an arrant puppy On the contrary he sarcastically observed
he would do well enough for a lord
Having brought matters in the family of Lord Hazard to a sort of stand still the reader and I will now if he please take a walk across the bridge into Roebuck park But upon recollection being come now to the center which commands a view of the whole village of Castlewick and its inhabitants making a part of our dramatis personae we will take a short view of that little community which had really something to recommend it to our notice
CHAPTER V
IN WHICH A VILLAGE IS DESCRIBED NOT UNLIKE AN ANT-HILL
THE village of Castlewick contained about five hundred inhabitants About half the men and boys were generally employed at the trade of wool-combing part of the women and girls in carding spinning twisting and knitting the more intelligent and experienced of the men in journeying to large towns to purchase sheep and supply factors clothiers and hosiers with wool yarn worsted stockings nightcaps socks and such other articles as they manufactured The lower order of the men and boys were employed in tilling manuring and enclosing and the remainder of the women busied themselves in household affairs buying and selling the necessaries of life and such other occupations as the vicar—for this parish had no curate—pointed out to them
The vicar had two deputies the clerk and the schoolmaster and these three were all the persons in the village who did no bodily labour—for Castlewick could boast neither lawyer exciseman nor apothecary
Their good pastor undertook to regulate the temporal as well as spiritual concerns of his flock and by a scrupulous discharge of his duty as their treasurer shewed them more than by a thousand precepts how much it was their interest to act with truth and integrity towards each other Not that his preaching was not of a piece with his example for every Sunday they heard some new lesson of sweet and comfortable morality from his mouth for he instead of describing religion as a denunciation of vengeance and the deity as delighting in punishment softened that high duty into a gentle and intelligent system of morality by inculcating the principles of social virtue and brotherly love and representing the creator as an indulgent father watching with anxious and tender care over the interest and happiness of his children and regarding their virtuous endeavours with a smile of celestial benevolence—thus troubling his hearers with nothing beyond the reach of that capacity which had fallen to their share and leaving the discussion of dogmas to larger communities who better understood cavilling
The clerk and the schoolmaster kept an account of the receipts and disbursements throughout the parish These were faithfully audited by the vicar Ten of the most considerable of the inhabitants who acted as a committee for the rest were called in every week to the vestry where the books were always forth coming for general inspection
Every other regulation for the pleasure and advantage of this happy community was proportionably wise and salutary Thus cheerfulness smiled on their labours content converted their pittance into plenty health ease and good humour accompanied their steps and they passed their time in the exercise of as much moral rectitude as would have immortalized them—had they been born ancient Spartans—without dreaming they did more than a common duty for the sake of general convenience
By this time I believe the reader begins to suspect that the vicar however well disposed to lend a helping hand towards the regulation of this little commonwealth as well as the clerk and the schoolmaster who kept the account of their finances were but subordinate actors in this performance and here introduced like the centinels in Hamlet and the servants in the Orphan—both of which circumstances VOLTAIRE is very angry at—only to usher in the capital personage who having once made his appearance is to receive all the applause
It must be owned that the motions of Castlewick appeared to be as regular as those of its church clock which clock though any blacksmith could wind it up and set it a going must have required a much better mechanic to have invented it originally If there should be a hidden first cause for this it will be announced in its proper place In the mean time I cannot prevail upon myself to repent my having introduced these sons of industry insignificant as they are The mind is often both improved and amused by the most trifling objects the smaller the mite the more worthy the curiosity of the philosopher
CHAPTER VI
WHICH PROVES THAT SOME OF THE OLD FASHIONS ARE NOT TO BE DESPISED
MY reader and I having passed through the rookery that received us as we left the bridge are now within sight of the mansion of Sir Sydney Walter Roebuck lord of the manor of Castlewick and member of parliament for the borough of Neitherside
The grandfather of this gentleman—for were I to trouble the reader with any thing anterior my description would resemble a game of chess where bishops knights castles and the king and queen are continually crossing each other Indeed I have two other reasons for not going farther back one is that in the course of this history Sir Sidney will talk to us a little about the fame of his ancestors himself and the other that for ought I could ever learn their lives were take them all in all such a uniform mixture of morality loyalty and brotherly love that the description of one would serve for the whole Their tempers might not be unaptly compared to a bowl of punch for though made up of the same contrariety of ingredients in common with the rest of their fellow creatures the mixture was so happily blended that they diffused comfort and cheerfulness to all around them
The grandfather then having taken umbrage at court for being turned out of the cabinet only because he maintained that the Lancashire witches were harmless old women—for which indeed Dr JOHNSON would have been as angry with him as the council were for he tells us he will not say there never was any such thing as witchcraft for that probably there might have been but that it had ceased—retired to the mansion of his forefathers which gothic and stately structure the reader and I are looking at
There having sat contentedly down with a quiet conscience an active mind and a princely fortune he considered—which was nothing more than his daily custom—how he might best be serviceable to his fellow creatures
He had not deliberated long on the subject before he determined to build the village of Castlewick and like another Bishop Blaze set up the trade of wool-combing Nor was this would he argue a project unworthy his rank wool was the staple commodity of that country he so dearly loved and for which his ancestors had so gallantly shed their blood the wool sack was the emblem of honour for it sustained the leading member of the house and took place in that assembly of every thing but the throne He had yet a better reason his scheme would give employment to his tenants and other poor neighbours and he should be sure to receive the daily blessings of many families who would owe a subsistance to their honest labours under the auspices of his bounty
This gentleman lived to see his benevolent plan carried into execution and he enjoined his son to pursue it This injunction was faithfully complied with but the present Sir Sidney considerably increased the number of houses and inhabitants altered the former rules and orders into a more regular and digested set of laws and called in the vicar and his adherents as the reader has already seen to assist him in their execution
Thus burning the Lancashire witches was productive of one public benefit at least for had not the humanity of good old Sir Sidney taken fire at the cruel proposition in all probability the village of Castlewick would never have been built
The surviving gentleman of this family I now take the liberty of introducing in form to the reader He had many singularities one I have already hinted at another was a fixed aversion to cards and dice yet he was a strenuous encourager of all athletic sports He would sometimes pitch the bar himself and was allowed to be the best bowler at cricket within ten miles He was an admirer of the arts and never failed to bring with him from town at the end of every sessions a poet a painter and a musician who were obliged—and so indeed were all others who wished for his esteem—to accompany him in the different departments of his duty as he called the regulation of his little commonwealth Nay sometimes he would set them to work on which occasion he enjoyed their awkwardness
Seeing once the wig of a counsellor catch in the girt of a twisting mill as he was unhandily turning it round it afforded no small diversion to the baronet who facetiously exclaimed
My good old friend you let your learning fly about at a strange rate
No man was more admired nor sought less to be so than Sir Sidney Even the boobies with whom he could not mix because he never swore gamed nor drank pint bumpers declared he was a gruffish odd sort of a hearty cock In short his heart was benevolent his means were ample he was in the prime of life surrounded with hundreds of sincere friends—which is a bold thing to say-respected valued esteemed adored almost deified and yet he was not happy I could tell the reader why but shall only so far indulge him as to say that according to Sir Sidneys own account his unhappiness was occasioned by a phantom he had seen which had so possessed him that he could not rest in his bed till he had opened his mind to it—for were I to unriddle the whole secret of this ghost the spirit and the readers curiosity would vanish together
I shall therefore collect together all the leading circumstances that I may the more adroitly introduce the time when the place where and the manner how it appeared And this has been a privilege to authors and old women time immemorial a climax having ever been allowed the proper moment to introduce a catastrophe and the candles burning blue a signal for the approach of a hobgoblin
As soon therefore as I shall have terrified my readers into a belief of the proper prognostic the ghost shall stalk forth To suffer this sooner would be inartificial and consequently an impeachment of my capacity of tantalizing the reader which would be an indelible disgrace to the fraternity of novel writers some of whom have excited no other sensation
I hope however I shall be forgiven if I differ in the main from this mode of constructing my work and not deemed an innovator if I endeavour to make satisfaction keep pace with expectation
CHAPTER VII
CONTAINING THE NECESSARY SHADOW TO HEIGHTEN THE BEAUTIES OF CASTLEWICK
I MEAN to lead the reader on chapter after chapter through this history in the same manner as we are led day after day through life They who experience the largest portions of human happiness are sure to have some unpleasant moments in every four-and-twenty hours whereas the same degree of misery will not so far overcome the fortitude of others but they find now and then a transient gleam of pleasure which like an accidental creek through the wall of a dungeon magnifies the light of comfort by peeping in upon obscurity
At the close of every dull day we naturally look forward in hopes of finding the next more agreeable Thus people comfort themselves with
tomorrow is a new day—we shall see how matters will go to-morrow
and thus cherish a laudable expectation though it end perhaps only in disappoinment
I am led to these remarks by the recollection of my having promised to tell the reader what Sir Sidney wanted to make him completely happy To do this suddenly and without preparation would seem to shew that I know not the way to elevate and surprise a mystery which more than Mr Bayes have thought the most essential requisite of an author
As no reader therefore can reasonably desire me to violate a standing rule I shall now proceed to unfold a nice chain of circumstances which will lead directly to the main event
In the description that has been given of Castlewick I more than doubt I have been shrewdly suspected of that kind of embellishment in which heroes are said to deal when speaking of their exploits and lovers when extolling the charms of their mistresses In fact to suppose a body of nearly five hundred people of different sexes ages and complexions could be perfectly secure from evil in themselves or guarded against the temptations of others would be to suppose an order of beings that certainly shall not intrude themselves here my intention being to treat of human creatures the best of whom I am afraid are not exempt from frailty I would only have it understood that vices existed in Castlewick no longer than till they were found out at which time the parties were for the first offence reprehended for a second mulct for a third condemned to have no intercourse with their neighbours and for a fourth considered as incorrigible and without favour or affection banished from the place and deprived for ever of any claim to its advantages
When this happened which I will say was very seldom the offenders generally took refuge in another village about three miles distant called Little Hockley the inhabitants of which place were mostly tenants of Lord Hazard and as that nobleman had found no great difficulty in bringing over the men and the women too to any of his purposes it may easily be supposed they were a very likely people to afford such a left-handed asylum
Little Hockley then was as famous for springes trammel nets and pitched battles as Castlewick was for cricket quoits and tranquillity and if one was without an attorney that a proper number of that worthy fraternity might be kept up the other maintained two Nay a spruce young man who indeed had been porter to an obscure druggist in a blind alley near Rosemary-lane established himself there as an apothecary who when Lord Hazard first began to reside at his seat ordered a new sign and added to his former qualifications surgeon and man-midwife
One great pleasure of the wicked wights of Little Hockley was to torment their more fortunate neighbours of Castlewick This they effected by certain railings and backbitings to which exploits of their fancy they added others which were achieved by means of their fingers for scarcely a week past but some hog was hamstrung horse lamed or house dog hanged Sucking pigs and chickens disappeared from their sties and roosts without the assistance of a fox the cows were milked in the night by two-handed urchins and lambs ran away with by two-legged wolves
These depredations ceased now and then upon Sir Sidneys application to Lord Hazard but they constantly broke out again In the mean time certain defiances were breathed and sometimes a few blows exchanged
The vicar was not without frequent apprehensions that some of his parishioners meeting with so many insulting provocations and being healthy spirited men would once for all take such a revenge as might involve the community in trouble for one or two of them had been already cited to the quarter sessions where it required the whole interest of Sir Sidney to prevent their paying heavy damages though what they did was perhaps in resentment of some insult offered to a wife or daughter
At the time Lord Hazard petitioned the lords for his divorce Sir Sidney was attending with great earnestness his duty in the lower house Taking advantage of this opportunity a month had scarcely passed before the Hockley men grown more audacious than ever had irritated their peaceable neighbours so often that three stout bruising matches had already been the consequence and though the Hockley boxers would have cut no contemptible figure in the learned Mr MENDOZAs school yet it so happened—perhaps because a right cause is half the victory—the men of Castlewick were the conquerors
Seeing matters at this extremity and unwilling to trouble Sir Sidney the vicar determined to pay a visit to the curate of Little Hockley for that parish which was a rectory had not been blest with a sight of its incumbent for ten years Indeed that worthy member of the church who was also a member of a gaming club commuted for the tithes and all other immunities of his living and had given up among other advantages the right of appointing a curate
The gentleman who made this purchase lived in the neighbourhood and was called Major Malplaquet He had distinguished himself in the wars of the low countries when very young under the famous Duke of MALBOROUGH and was now late in life in quiet possession of his paternal seat and a very fine fortune
The Major had a chaplain who it must be confessed did not look much like a clergyman He had been in the wars too and indeed he fought much better than he prayed I will illustrate his character by an anecdote
A clergyman being on a visit to a captain of a man of war a smart gale sprung up so suddenly that the vessel parted her cable and was hurried out to sea No harm happened but it gave the crew a great deal of trouble The boatswain who in the language of his messmates was a dry hand coming upon the forecastle cried
Sink me if I did not think as this would be the case I will be keelhauled if we have had a bit of good luck since that there parson came aboard Of all the fish that swims I cannot abide a parson I never sailed but once before with a parson and then we had not a fair wind the whole voyage
Never but once said one of his companions why a chaplains parson ent he
Avast that slack chatter said the boatswain a chaplain a parson hey
Why I tell you he is says the other he wears black and says prayers
Why then I suppose retorted the boatswain the devils an alderman because he wears horns—All the chaplains I ever knew were honest hearty cocks good fellows who would not mind making a curtain of their black gown to hide a pretty lass None of your grave thinking gentlemen but roaring boys who
shewing
you what they are and
telling
you what they ought to be leave you to your choice whether youll go to heaven by their preaching or to the southward by their example
This worthy member of the church militant whose name was Standfast had in his younger days—for he was now near fifty—performed as many exploits of the buckish kind as ever distinguished the Mohawks Sweaters or any other set of desperados who used formerly to parade the streets of London to the terror of every decrepid watchman and the demolition of his lanthorn He was the very man who once proposed to give the waiter of a coffee-house a rouleau to see
how he would look
Besides all this he had killed his man and having absconded to Flanders he ran away with a nun from a convent married her spent her fortune set her adrift and entered a volunteer in the army where the officers—finding him a genteel man—being informed of his function procured him a chaplaincy
In this situation Standfast was particularly noticed by Major Malplaquet who being a man of singular credulity so attached himself to his new acquaintance that he soon became his all in all Indeed the chaplain had many qualities that rendered him agreeable to the major He would drink claret play at put and beat a reveille with any man in the corps Besides these winning accomplishments he had other accommodating methods of endearing himself to his patron He often complimented him with the possession of some yielding female he had himself grown tired of and never failed if husbands or fathers grew impertinent and troublesome to brazen the matter out In short having gained a consummate knowledge of the world by a scrupulous hardness of belief a total want of every feeling but self-interest and a critical exercise of observation he penetrated every mans characteristic foible and worked upon it as he pleased
Such was the Rev Mr Standfast private chaplain to Major Malplaquet and curate of Little Hockley To this person I am going to introduce the vicar of Castlewick who conscious of the rectitude of his own intentions was indulging himself in the flattering hope that his efforts in conjunction with those of the curate would effectually make up every breach between the two contending parties
CHAPTER VIII
BEING FULL OF PASTIME AND PRODIGALITY
To the qualities already celebrated in Tiger Standfast—for so had he been nicknamed by his companions from the utter impossibility of taming him—I shall add that let him converse with whom he might he as the phrase is knew his man and was always provided with so many shifts and turns that come what would he was never off his guard Besides he had an admirable knack of siding with his enemy the better to laugh at him
I thought it necessary to premise this lest the reader should wonder how it came about that the moment he saw Mr Mildman he should not only welcome him with all imaginable courtesey but declare he intended the next morning to have paid him a visit in order to consult with him on the very subject which had now brought them together—adding as he took the good old vicar by the hand that he had a hard time of it indeed but bad examples were terrible things and if Lord Hazard would encourage his tenants in idleness—which Mr Mildmans experience must have long taught him is the corner stone of the temple of corruption—of what avail were all his prayers nay his tears in enforcing either their duty towards God or their neighbour
The astonished vicar could scarcely credit his ears He had not to learn the general character of Standfast but on the contrary had both heard and believed much ill of him and indeed on his way had uncharitably as he now thought conjured up a number of difficulties in his mind which he expected would be thrown in the way of his beneficent plan
This Standfast well knew and as the first blow in argument as well as boxing is a manifest advantage he had the inward satisfaction—I say inward because his features betrayed no such sensation—of seeing his antagonist struck aghast
To pursue this first blow therefore he thus went on
I see Mr Mildman you are shocked to find I have no more influence over my parishioners
The vicar to whom truth was as habitual as perjury is to an attorney with the utmost simplicity of heart immediately answered
You have not at all divined the subject of my astonishment I was admiring that the world could be so unnecessarily slanderous to have described you as a dissolute and immoral character and one who—pardon me for using the expression was a scandal to your cloth whereas you appear to me—
Ah cried Standfast poor deluded wretches I forgive them But what do they say It is of consequence that I should clear my character to you Their slander I smile at but your ill opinion What do they say dear Mr Mildman
Why Sir replied the vicar since I see you bear it with a proper firmness I will tell you—
Sit down sir said Standfast
The vicar having complied with his request proceeded to inform him that in the first place it was said he drank very hard for a clergyman
Not a drop more in general than two bottles at a sitting said Standfast and never more than four
Four bottles exclaimed the vicar
Why what is that cried Standfast very calmly if my dear sir you had been in countries where I have you must have drank Ay ay it is better to be carried off to bed in liquor than in an ague Then between ourselves the major is a notable toper never stirs till the sixth bottle though there should be only he and I to drink it and I dare not disoblige my patron I hate ingratitude I only ask you Mr Mildman if any thing could induce you to thwart the will of Sir Sidney
Sir cried the vicar with a look of extreme sensibility it is the study of my life to deserve his bounty
That was spoken said Standfast too warmly not to have come from the heart You must my dear sir pledge me in a glass to Sir Sidneys health Here bring some wine
The vicar who though he never was drunk in his life could take a glass or two and very frequently did at Sir Sidneys table made no great difficulty to comply
Two bottles of wine were immediately brought two glasses poured out and soon emptied to the health of the vicars patron Standfast asked Mr Mildman if he liked his port as well as Sir Sidneys at the same time excusing himself from drinking any saying that nothing but claret agreed with him
The vicar commended the wine but said it had a dryish sour smack after it

Goute de la terreinne
nothing else said Standfast it is the very excellence of it
Perhaps so said the vicar but to our business
No sir said Standfast you shall purge me of all my secret faults It has long been my ambition to be known to you and I promise most truly if you can use any fair argument before you go to convince me of the least impropriety in my conduct I will amend it immediately
Sir said the vicar it is handsomely said and after this declaration I will not believe you the man you have been represented to me You a murderer
A murderer echoed Standfast I abhor the idea
I dare say you do sir cried the vicar and yet the wicked world says you killed a man in a duel
Oh is that all said Standfast I was compelled to it Poor Ned—he was a worthy fellow— I had a great regard for him but he would insist upon it so I ran him through the body
Mercy on us cried the vicar and do you feel no remorse for having the blood of a fellow creature upon your head
Not in an affair of honour said Standfast It was impossible to be avoided
Honour cried the vicar with great vehemence it is a prostitution of the word Can it be honour because a man has perhaps unwittingly affronted me to shed his blood and desolate his family Is it honour because there are men of desperate fortunes with whom it is safer to face a pistol than a halter that I must either fear to detect their villany or put my life upon a footing with theirs
Spoken like an oracle my dear sir said Standfast but it will sometimes unavoidably happen that two men of perfect honour who wish one another extremely well shall suddenly dispute till grown warm one or the other shall use an opprobious epithet which his friend cannot brook What is to be done—the man must be knocked down you know
Knocked down hollowed the vicar and so make the breach too wide for all possibility of reparation No sir the highest courage is to pity passion not take advantage of it Convince a man into a concession and your triumph is doubly noble Why should a fally of passion be sooner resented than the sally of a madman Besides according to your own rules not to speak of its wickedness can any thing be so silly as duelling A man receives an injury what is the satisfaction he asks why truly he invites the aggressor in terms of perfect politeness to meet him at a certain time where he requests as an attonement for the wrong that his adversary may exert all his skill to take away his life
The vicar who had now drank two glasses made the above declaration with uncommon vehemence Standfast in a pretended rapture embraced him confessed he was become his convert and filling the glasses for the third time gave the major for a toast
This the vicar could not avoid drinking He determined however it should be the last three glasses being at any time his utmost stint He had scarcely drank when whether it was owing to the
goute de la terreinne
or being warm upon the subject or what I shall not now take upon me to say but certainly he gave manifest signs of being disordered from top to toe His eyes sparkled his head became dizzy and his chair was of the same use to him as a pole is to a rope-dancer for without it he assuredly would have tumbled down Nor could he help testifying some applause at the end of a little
chansonette
which Standfast had been negligently singing At this the latter declared with a violent oath that he was the heartiest companion he ever knew
The vicar blamed him severely for swearing but stamping his foot to enforce the rebuke he trod upon the leg of a dog that lay before the fire The cur having received a private intimation from his master flew at the vicar who with great difficulty and an exclamation of
damn the dog
got out of his way
Standfast now fell foul of the vicar telling him that he might plainly see there were provocations that might induce a man to swear that the words themselves were no more than other words and that men used indiscriminately God bless you and its opposite expression when neither a benediction nor a curse was in their hearts which he was sure was the case in relation to the vicar as the exclamation against the dog was certainly uttered without the smallest premeditated malice
Oh sir said poor Mildman whose speech now became affected I would not wish the destruction of the smallest reptile As to the poor dumb creature what he did was natural I trod upon him and he flew at me I did him an injury and he resented it
Just my case said Standfast in the affair of the duel
Oh no cried the vicar as to the duel—the duel—you see in relation to the duel—a man that is intoxicated with passion—
is as bad interrupted Standfast as a man intoxicated with liquor
Oh yes cried the vicar that is another terrible evil When a man is drunk he feels—that is the liquor mounts to his head—and if the giddiness—which is the effect of—what is the matter with me—I—but it is no such thing—it is—im—im—impossible that—Oh dear me—
Poor Mildman sinking back in his chair now fell fast asleep which Standfast no sooner saw than he ordered in two sturdy fellows who were at hand and bid them lay the vicar in a certain field where some of his flock would be sure to find him
This was all that Standfast really meant for being a perfect school boy at a frolic and having long indulged a desire of touching the vicar on the side of his sobriety upon hearing of his coming to consult with him he had infused a few grains of crude opium into a bottle of port which caused that
goute de la terreine
the vicar complained of and so acted both upon his head and his unsuspicious temper as at the third glass to throw him into a complete state of intoxication
This deception I should have imparted at the beginning of this chapter but for my constant observance of that necessary etiquette which I hinted to my readers in the beginning of the last
The two fellows however who carried out the vicar were not so easily contented To get the parson completely into their clutches was such a triumph that they were determined to make the most of it They therefore stript him of his coat put him on an old jerkin patched with a hundred different colours set him in the middle of a field upon a broken chair propt up by a few stakes to prevent him from falling where he looked exactly like a figure placed to frighten the crows
Very fortunately for the poor vicar the clerk and the schoolmaster passed over the field a few minutes after the Hockley men had left him They were going to Little Hockley with a view to meet the good man and learn the success of his enterprize and were scarcely within a hundred yards of the supposed scarecrow when they saw it move of itself as it appeared for there was not a breath of wind stirring Upon this looking with more attention it got upon its legs staggered two or three paces and fell down
Perfectly convinced it must be a human being they went up to it but what words can describe their astonishment when they heard the voice and beheld the features of the vicar
The two men who had stood aloof now made their appearance They were soon afterwards joined by almost half the village who seeing the vicar in the hands of his friends began to open upon them
Fine doings indeed said one ay ay the still sow sucks all the grains
Yes yes cried another there be black sheep at Castlewick as well as at other places
The clerk and schoolmaster retorted that they were sure some trick had been played
Odd rot it said a third a reare trick to be sure Here must your parson cum to zee our parson and nothing would zarve un as he zed but bleeding the zellers and zo you do zee after he had got mean drunk we took and geed un an airing in our veeld to fright away the crows—
Odds wounds cried another your drunken parson makes a mortal good scarecrow
at which they all set up a horse laugh
The clerk and the schoolmaster having asked the vicar several questions and found from his utter incapacity to give a rational answer they stood very little chance of knowing the truth—for as to a single tittle to his prejudice nothing could induce them to credit it—they contented themselves with demanding his coat hat and wig which were peremptorily refused the ringleader swearing they should be put upon a figure of the vicar and that very night burnt in effigy
Seeing that all their attempts to recover these spoils were in vain their next care was how to get home their charge when fortunately a tilted cart happening to go by they called the driver who knowing them with great readiness assisted to convey the vicar to his vehicle heartily concerned at his deplorable condition and vowing revenge against those who had reduced him to it
The cart set off one way and the crowd another shouting in triumph as they bore away their trophies and swearing to exhibit them upon a pile of faggots as soon as it should be dark
Whether they did so or not will be known hereafter but not in the next chapter that being appropriated for another subject Besides the reader may wish to be released for a time from the brutes of Little Hockley Nay it is not impossible but he may in some small degree revolt at these latter circumstances What a shocking indignity to make so amiable a man drunk let him swear and afterwards introduce him as a scarecrow
To these objections—for I own I am myself shocked at the facts—I must beg to plead that I am only the historian of these transactions but if I were the inventor I really think that they are the very cunning of the scene for the more attrocious the Hockley men appear the more lustre will be thrown round the worthies of Castlewick
As for the swearing I own I had some idea of smothering it but I will prove beyond contradiction that it is natural even in the excellent Mr Mildman
The reader cannot wish for a more truly moral character to illustrate the position than Doctor JOHNSON This great man we are told by Mr BOSWEL while on his tour once made use of the words
what the devil
—I forget whether it was on that evening the young lady sat upon his knee for then there would have been no great improbability in his feeling the gentleman he mentioned a little busy—but he hastily recalled himself and corrected his expression
Now
what the devil
from Dr JOHNSON perfectly sober I insist upon it is about upon a par with
damn the dog
from Mr Mildman drunk for drunkenness has the same effect upon the spirits whether we fall into it by accident or design Nay drugs and charms may very likely create a stronger delirium and I have no manner of doubt but that if Dr JOHNSON could that evening have been prevailed upon to drink fermented liquor it is within bare possibility—for I contend for no more—that he might have whispered to his friend BOSWELL that the lady was a damned fine girl or some such buckishness
CHAPTER IX
SHEWING WHO ARE THE PROPER CONFIDENTS IN CASES OF LOVE
STANDFAST as soon as he understood what had been done with the vicar appeared well enough satisfied though he did not fail to declare that the matter had been carried a great deal too far However at the majors in the evening he gave the story in all its perfection enlarging a little indeed on one article which was in saying that the vicar drank like a fish—
but said he looking very earnestly at Mrs Malplaquet few virtues are so practicable as people would feign teach us to believe The detection of one hypocrite has in it merit enough to atone for fifty sins openly committed What say you major
Why I say replied the major that hypocrisy is a low sin a kind of rank and file vice and ought to be drumed out of every regiment of honest fellows Dont you think so chicken said he to his wife
Certainly I do said she and as no man alive has less of that meanest of vices than yourself I may the more freely utter my detestation of it
You may be assured the worst of hypocrites is he who covers his deceit with the practice of other vices All you can do with such a man is not to trust him too far but how dreadful it is to be always doubting a man you would wish to think well of You will say he keeps you a stranger to his hypocrisy and leaves you almost secure he is no such character by openly avowing his other sins This very circumstance ought to excite your suspicion of his honesty for what does he see in one friend more than another unless perhaps to make him his dupe
This may be all very true madam said Standfast but I must say it appears to me to be a very uncharitable kind of judgment I hope there are no such persons as you describe
I am sure sir I should be as willing to hope so as you said the lady but I cannot give myself that indulgence for uncharitable as it may be I still insist that there is one such character at least in the world
Come come I hope not said the major if it were only for the honour of the corps of human nature
Well said the lady since it has gone so far I beg that I may have leave to prove what I advance merely to clear myself from Mr Standfasts imputation of uncharitableness
I will suppose a case A gentleman shall be in your house as Mr Standfast is receive your protection countenance and friendship and in the moment you are heaping benefits upon him—in full assurance that you count every thing upon his gratitude—shall harbour dishonourable designs against your wife shall eternally teaze her when she is alone behave himself so particular to her in company that she is obliged to force that deportment into constraint which she could wish should be cheerfulness and in the mean time she dreads to make her persecutions known for fear of ill consequences from the anger of her husband In what order of hypocrites would you class this man What would he deserve
Deserve cried the major to be flogged till every thread of hemp was worn off the cat o nine tails But pray now chicken do you mean this as mere general conversation or is there any thing intended by it
Oh that is impossible said Standfast nudging her at the same time under the table
Perhaps not cried the lady enjoying his confusion at any rate you have no objection to my making it known I hope
I—no—Oh no madam—I—not the least—and then recovering himself a little—not the smallest objection you may be assured
Very well sir said Mrs Malplaquet since it is a matter of such perfect indifference to you I will take an opportunity when I am tete a tete with my husband of endeavouring to shew him his friends from his enemies At present added she I should be obliged to you to ring the bell it may recover you from your fright
Standfast did as he was desired the ladys woman made her appearance and she retired to her chamber saying as she went out
adieu major and for you Mr Standfast I wish you this and every night as sweet a repose with all your virtues as that of Mr Mildman with all his hypocrisy
The two gentlemen being left to themselves a silence of a few minutes ensued At length the major got up suddenly and having shut the door and locked it advanced to Standfast in a most determined stride and uttered in as determined a tone
Looke Sir—if I thought I harboured a rascal in my house I would not wait for a court martial—his ears—damme his ears should in two minutes be nailed against the wall in terrorum to all scoundrels who dared to come as spies into a gentlemans camp That my wife meant something is evident that she would not run a risk of exasperating me without cause is as evident tell me therefore what you know of the matter for fire me Mr Standfast but it shall be explained
Standfast who had taken good time to sort his cards began now to consider how he should play his game and knowing the majors credulity to his strongest suit after stipulating for a patient hearing he thus began
You very well know major you are upwards of seventy whereas your lady is not more than twenty-five She married you against her will out of mere filial piety and I sincerely believe has been as faultless in her conduct as she is beautiful in her person You have often said our souls were congenial and that though there were no consanguinity between us nature made us brothers Is it wonderful then I should admire what you do When the desertion of a recreant pin has displayed her spreading bosom bursting like a lily from its pod or a friendly stile betrayed her taper leg to my view I will not deny but it has fired my imagination and in the sweet madness of that delicious moment I have been a rascal—have loved your wife—have told her of it—
Oh major you do not know what it is to cherish a hopeless passion you are happy you possess the object of your wishes while I pine in despair
In despair ay and so you ought cried the major what the devil would the man have Hant you my friendship my credit my purse
None of which I deserve said Standfast
Why no I think not indeed returned the major if you cannot be content without my wife into the bargain No no I chuse if you please sir to have her affections to myself
Come come said Standfast major that is too much you know she did not marry you for love She may have a friendship for you but assure yourself no affection at her age for a man of yours
Why grumbled the major there may be something in that but still sir that is nothing to you
It is so far something to me said Standfast that it serves me to exculpate myself for if she had loved you I would sooner have cut my tongue out of my mouth than have suffered it even to have whispered my passion But you see how very excuseable I am Younger than you by almost twenty years versed all my life in the arts of pleasing women and you know very well how many I have spared you in the charming days of our youth
Well well said the major that I dont pretend to deny
Many a delicious girl returned Standfast that doted on me have I torn from my own arms to present to my friend
So you have—so you have—said the major
And what thanks you gave me for it said Standfast Dont you remember the little auburn haired wench at Ghent
What the counsellors wise cried the major She was a charming woman by my faith Come give me some wine I wonder what is become of her
I dont know said Standfast but major neither you nor I boggled at her being married that I recollect
True true cried the major but that you know was a different affair
It was indeed returned Standfast for I insist upon it I shewed myself in that instance capable of a more exalted friendship than you are for I loved her possessed her and yet gave her up to you deprived myself of a sweet felicity to oblige my friend Ah major you never got the start of me but in this last business How different things used to be The gayest the most accomplished yielded to me in the art of pleasing and till I was satisfied none dared attempt to make a choice—Now a foolish woman who loves neither of us is to sow dissention between two friends who are all the world to each other
Damme cried the major but she shall not and if it was only a mistress curse me if I dont think that tongue of yours would prevail with me not to stand upon niceties but you know Standfast as it is
Oh cried the chaplain however miserable I may be I will consume in silence rather than utter another syllable
Well that is friendly said the major However returned the chaplain I hope you will lay an injunction on Mrs Malplaquet to treat me with civility
Oh you may depend upon that answered the major
And I think said Standfast I may venture to insist that I am not the hypocrite the lady has thought proper to call me
Ill answer for that said the major
No no repeated the chaplain any scoundrel if you please Mrs Malplaquet but a hypocrite
After this upon asking the major if there was any remaining animosity his patron shook him heartily by the hand and swore he believed him to be the worthiest fellow upon earth
for where said he is there another man who being in love with your wife would have the honesty to confess it to your face
Having brought this dialogue between tame credulity and unblushing impudence to an end I shall only add that this worthy friendship seemed to be stronger cemented by what had passed
The remainder of the conversation turned on their former exploits in which Standfast did not lose sight of the main point but enlarged wherever he could on the satisfaction he had always received in administering to the majors pleasures
At length the major was led off to bed in much about the same state of inebriety as the reader may remember to have seen Mr Mildman
Before I take my leave of this chapter I shall say a word or two concerning Mrs Malplaquet
This lady who was one of those living sacrifices which avarice offers up at the shrine of interest had to say the truth a very difficult task to perform Her parents though sprung from an honourable family were of a younger branch and therefore could give her but a thousand pounds The only man she ever loved had deserted her for a pert piece of deformity with just thirty times that sum Thus being perfectly indifferent what became of herself she gave her hand as the good chaplain has already kindly noticed to the major out of perfect obedience to her friends
The life she had led since—the only pleasurable moments of which were those she passed alone—may be easily guessed The audacious importunities of Standfast were much bolder than either he or she had described and he having repeated them in some way that night so as extremely to offend her—though she was remarkable for complacency and sweetness of temper—her anger had so far got the better of her forbearance as to force from her that declaration of Standfasts dishonourable intentions which the reader has already seen he contrived by the power he had over his patron so to palliate as to leave her the object of resentment rather than him
I mention this for fear Mrs Malplaquet for whom I would wish to interest the reader should be wrongfully supposed to be one of those outrageously virtuous ladies who are eternally singing forth their own praises lest the world from its natural uncharitableness should unkindly imagine they are entitled to no praise at all—a practice at present in great and general credit And really I do not see why it should not for who so proper to be the herald of a mans merits as himself since he is surely competent to speak to his own motives from a thorough knowledge of whence they originate And if he should turn the best side outward it ought to be considered as a meritorious expedient to put himself upon a footing with his neighbour and so pay him in his own coin appearance being as requisite to establish one sort of reputation as paper to establish another neither of which could sustain any solid credit without such assistance for honour is a commerce as well as business and such ideal resources often prevent bankruptcies in both
CHAPTER X
CONTAINING TWO NEW CHARACTERS—PERFECTLY ORIGINAL
THE worthy curate in his way home exulting at this new instance of his influence over the major uttered or rather I believe reflected the following soliloquy
Zounds what an escape—but it is nothing to a genius like mine Poor dolt how gloriously I ride him As to madam I fancy shell tell no more tales This is reducing things to a system but I always said it To palliate an accusation if you take a man by that foible his generosity you are sure to be safe Men are always liberal when there is nothing required but words
But to expedients This woman is a fool I had a scheme to her advantage Her husband cannot live long especially as I drench him and would she join me we might make a comfortable thing ont when once I should have preached his funeral sermon Well if she will kick down her basket of glass ware that is her business I will try her however once more I am secure from any impertinent tattling The major will hear no more complaints If she comes to I shall be charmed for to say the truth she is a lovely woman if not shall I stake my interest against her folly No not were she a Venus
To-morrow I will begin the attack and if she should not capitulate in a week I will then appear to raise the siege but it shall be only to prepare a mine which when once sprung shall either destroy her or make her prisoner at the mercy of her conqueror in which case she will not find in me the continence of POMPEY or ALEXANDER—No no my business is to talk of virtue let fools practise it who are content to take it for their reward
Whether all or any part of Standfasts plan was put in execution will hereafter be seen When he came to the above period he had just finished his meditation and his walk and having knocked at his door was let in by his confidential servant who beat Scrub out of sight in point of variety in his employments for as Scrub had one employment for every day in the week Mr Flush—for that was his name—had one for almost every day in the year Nor to say the truth was there ever any person better cut out for a great mans appendage for I hope the reader already allows Mr Standfast to be a great man and as to Mr Flush or Mr Kiddy Flush—for he had also a nick name—if a fork be necessary to a knife fuel to a fire a scabbard to a sword a bucket to a well a bailiff to an attorney or a bully to a bawd the services of that faithful adherent were essentially material and absolutely necessary to his worthy principal nay I question if Kiddy was not very near if not altogether as great an original as his master
As however my opinion is of very little consequence if my good reader does not coincide with it I think it absolutely incumbent on me to delineate the portrait of the said Flush or Kiddy—for he was as often called one as the other—so let the claim to superiority rest either on the side of the man or master as it shall appear by the drawing and as it is usual in portraits to illustrate the character by some cymbolical ornament through the means of which you can lay your finger on the canvas and say this is a general for he has a truncheon in his hand and this a butcher for he has a nosegay in his bosom so will I give the like infallible traits to know the characteristic marks of Kiddys most striking qualities
As to his person it was for his size—for he was only four feet eleven inches high—the most compact that ever was seen but then as if nature had been fearful had she finished the front of this well proportioned structure equal to the rest of the work lest she should have been tempted to have thrown down her tools in despair his face was the most singular piece of deformity that can be conceived
His nose and chin like the head and tail of a weathercock pointed different ways yet not east and west nor north and south but to the zenith and nadir
Some were of opinion that he had no mouth when he was born but that the operator had made an incision to serve for one and that being in a hurry and his scissors none of the sharpest he had not only cut it in an oblique direction from the right side of the under jaw up to the left cheek bone but also zig zag so that when he laughed—indeed laugh he never did—but when he grinned—for his teeth were pretty even which lends probability to the business of the incision—
But pray excuse me from relating how he looked when he grinned till I have described his eyes one of which the left was smaller than the other and whether it envied the superior size of its neighbour or was awed by conscious humility at its own insignificance I really cannot say but it fairly slunk into the opposite corner without even deigning or perhaps daring to cast one single glance to the right while the other in triumphant pride rolled or rather goggled about and appeared itself an Argus looking a hundred ways at once
To these unlovely marks—which in females are called certificates for their honesty—I must add that Kiddy was frightfully seamed with the small pox and that he received no addition in point of beauty from an explosion of gunpowder when he was abroad which stript the skin off his face except on a small part of one of his cheeks and one or two other places and thereby left such a violent redness for ever after that his face looked something like a rump steak or rather like red ochre in the grinding in which if you take up the muller you may see an appearance like branches of trees which answers exactly to seams of the small pox or to add one more simile which shall take in beard and all—for his beard like that of Hudibras was orange tawny—his complexion was like a red wine syllabub where here and there appears a splotch of white curd the whole gently tinged with a sprinkling of nutmeg
As to the grinning after I have said so much I think I should affront the reader by describing it He knows every feature now as well as I do and if he chuses to call up a grin in his imagination and when he has so done does not grin himself I can only say he is not the reader I took him for
Kiddy Flush had been employed from his youth up to beat the drum distribute the bills and slang the figures of a puppet shew where he had learnt a smattering of every thing He could scrape the fiddle vault on the slack wire swear a good round hand coax the girls get boozy and I am afraid thieve for if he had not this last qualification I cannot see why they should send him hand-cuffed which they really did on board a transport whose destination was to the American plantations
In short not to conceal the disgrace Kiddy was certainly transported to America from whence he contrived to get re-transported to Ireland There he found means to get engaged as a drummer in the same regiment where Standfast was chaplain Indeed Kiddy Flush was the very person who taught Tiger Standfast to beat that reveille which has been already celebrated as a
chef doeuvre
Were I to run through all the scenes so full of srolic whim dissipation and singular dissoluteness which were practised by this trim tram this horse and his rider I might as well at once have given the world the adventures of Tiger Standfast and his man Kiddy but as that is not totally my intention I shall content myself with noticing that these worthy associates finding themselves very necessary to each other a league was entered into between them that mutual assistance should be given—to put the matter a little technically—in all breezes frisks plots queerings tricks humbugs and bambouzlings that they might find it expedient to engage in that the agreement should be understood as a partnership between them with this sole distinction that Flush should be openly considered as a servant and in that character be kept in subordination before company but permitted to speak his mind freely openly and without reserve when nobody should be present
Kiddy Flush at the time of his first introduction to the reader—for nothing is so advantageous as to bring on your principal characters with a good grace—was what is called half gone in his own language a little cockish for I must tell the reader—and that is really the last explanation I will trouble him with about Kiddy—that among the rest of his oddities his choice of words was the most singular It was composed of the cant terms of both his professions to which he occasionally added a miserable pun and now and then a little bad French which he had picked up on his travels the whole interlarded with new-fangled oaths
Kiddy had just been witness to a curious scene in the village and was bursting to disclose it to his master on his arrival At the same time it must be remembered that Standfasts head was entirely filled with what had passed at the majors
Kiddy then scarcely suffered his master to sit down before he began with
I say master there has been rum gig going forward this evening
Gig what do you mean said Standfast
his mind still running on his late adventure
Nay nothing said Flush no rang only we had like to have come off with tats thats all Shiver me if we had not been cute we should some of us have taken a leap without nobody to hold the blanket
Standfast thinking he alluded to the scrape he had so narrowly got out of replied
why how the devil came you to know any thing about it
Why Lord love you said Kiddy I know the whole manoeuvre of the thing and I must say it was bunglingly managed
Bunglingly said Standfast damme if I think any man in the world ever drew himself out of such a hobble with half so much grace To have them both upon me the old soldier and his wife
Why master what are you upon said Flush The jonse I means bent no old soldiers nor their wives but a parcel of sheep biting poltroons—flats—mazards—who instead of pelting it out like hearties sneaked away to the boozing cases and left the enemy masters of the champ of battle
He here acquainted Standfast that at the moment of exhibiting the effigy of the vicar on its funeral pile a party of heroes from Castlewick who had heard from the clerk and the schoolmaster of the indignity intended to be offered to their worthy pastor rushed in saved those precious relics from the flames and bore them off in triumph while the affrighted Hockleymen fled amazed scarcely offering to resist—and it was well they did for the vicars adherents would have died on the spot rather than have yielded
However said Flush for the honour of the cause I rallied the scums and spoke a speech to them as near as I can remember in these um here words
Says I—Splinter your joints what are you about Will you after this pretend to call yourselves hearty culls rum codgers or valiant dickies You lump the Castlewickites—you be damned Dont you see the queer kids have made off with the toggies But however this here I will say—you had no maulers and they took you by surprize Dont be down hearted then To day is for them to-morrow may be for us Kallenge them nolens volens to the field fifty against fifty like worthies Thump it out kindly and then if you lose why you die like cocks and we will sing tiddium over your graves What say you my good master to my horation Was it not great high and crackish
Oh very great indeed General Flush returned Standfast What effect had it
Effect exclaimed Flush Damme it took like a train In an hour the kallenge was sent a categorical returned and to-morrow at five we beat to arms
Bravo cried Standfast but remember I know nothing of this Stay a thought strikes me I can make this matter of use my pretty piece of temptation yonder is squeamish I will think ont but it is late Good night Flush— hearten your soldiers and dont forget that I must be a stranger to the whole business
The master and man here parted the one went to snooze as he called it and the other to meditate how he could make this accident of advantage to him
In this situation if the reader please we will leave them and return to the majors late as it is as I am anxious to make known what passed in the mind of Mrs Malplaquet after she retired to her appartment
That lady had a most faithful and honest friend in her handmaid Emma who was almost as singular a character as Flush though a perfect contrast for nothing in nature could be more harmless
Emma was the daughter of a bookseller in London who having a large family and being in no very flourishing circumstances was prevailed on to put her out as a ladys companion An advantageous recommendation brought her into the care of Mrs Malplaquet where she had been now retained for almost three years in which time she had made herself so necessary and so agreeable to her lady that nothing I believe could have prevailed on her to part with so valuable an acquisition
What made her company so particularly desirable was the astonishing fund of information she had treasured up by sitting in her fathers shop Her mind was a kind of circulating library in little and I sincerely wish romances were always attended with the same good effects they produced in her for there is scarcely a good moral inculcated by them that she did not act up to Not that she had not formed a decided opinion of writings as well as writers but she rarely broached that opinion thinking with Madam DACIER that silence was the best ornament of the female sex It was evident however that it was wisely and judiciously chosen for at the head of her favourite authors she placed Dr JOHNSON though I rather think her great admiration of him must have been as a critic for the Doctor is known to have entertained a rooted dislike to mythology and indeed every figurative writing which does not square with what he calls truth and morality whereas Emma maintained that morality being the noblest drift of literature those writings were the most perfect which brought virtue into danger that she might rise the more triumphant and that such productions received an additional force and beauty from allegory and mythological allusion
The various merits of our literary Abigail will gradually unfold themselves as we go on I thought it necessary to say so much to account for Mrs Malplaquets determination of disclosing to her the business of Standfasts audacity and to advise with her what steps she should take
Emma heard the whole affair with great deliberation and pausing for some moments her lady asked her of what she was considering
I am looking madam said she over the catalogue of my mind to see if I have ever read any thing like it and upon recollection the same thing occurs in the Nonjuror one of CIBBERs plays which is taken from the Tartuffe of MOLIERE who had it I believe from PLAUTUS—and if I might advise you should serve your parson as the lady in that play does hers
How is that said Mrs Malplaquet for I really forget
Why madam replied Emma she pretends to be caught in his snare while she is laying one for him and placing her husband so as to over-hear a pretended love scene between them his villany is detected and he is turned out of the house
I like the idea said the lady of all things in the world and with thy assistance am ready to set about it But how Emma if he should turn the tables upon us for he is very subtle
I know it very well madam said Emma for at this moment he is making as strong love to me as to yourself but I promise you he finds me a very Pamela
The lady expressed some surprize at this intelligence and asked her maid if she was not uneasy at it
On the contrary cried Emma I am charmed for to resist temptation is the proper exercise of virtue and serves as a kind of moral penance to strengthen us in our duty Oh I assure you madam you need not be uneasy one look from virtue though a lamb will as surely make vice crouch as the lion did at the sight of Una
By this time Mrs Malplaquet was undrest and soon after her maid retired which opportunity I shall seize to account for my having given two such subordinate characters as Flush and Emma so particular an introduction
To say the truth then I think that though the clown should say no more than is set down for him yet he should say all that is set down for him The devil has been considered by some as the principal character in Paradise Lost Comus on all hands is allowed to have the better of the lady Will any one pretend to say Don Quixote would be any thing without Sancho In all the Spanish plays the servants are the principal characters and I have heard the soldier in WESTs General Wolfe spoken of as the best figure in the groupe Emma would have defended this argument by saying that Honor is drawn in as masterly a style as Sophia and Flush would have told you that both man and master were human puppets moved by the same slangs In short I write for all readers and I hope I have scarcely a character but some one or other will pitch upon for my hero
CHAPTER XI
IN WHICH THE HISTORIAN FULFILS HIS PROMISE TO THE READER
THE challenge from the Hockleymen having been as Mr Flush informed us accepted by the Castlewickites a large plain known by the name of the cricket green situated near the high road about midway between the two villages was pitched upon for the scene of action Thither repaired the combatants and there were they drawn up in battle array every man poising his hedgestake when a gentleman in a post chaise and four who had ordered the postilion to mend his pace when he first saw a mob assembled came up and cried out in a pretty authoritative voice that if the inhabitants of Castlewick did not desist they should lose his favour for ever
The Castlewickites expected a very different word of command Finding however their present general to be no other than Sir Sidney they thought proper to throw down what Mr Flush called maulers Upon this the Hockley men began to spring forward with an exulting shout and would have dealt death among their unarmed enemies had not another authoritative voice commanded a suspension of hostilities on their part
This voice proceeded from no less a person than Mr Flush who having deliberately weighed the probable consequence of such violent proceedings began to think they would not be altogether so consistent with prudence He considered that the quarrel had originated with Standfast and that there would be enough to do without this new outrage to set matters to rights about the vicar It was therefore his business in quality of his masters friend—by means of which he knew he should be also his own—to soften matters and having an excellent opportunity owing to this piece of cowardice on the part of his adherents he holloed out as loud as his shrill pipe would permit him—
Why pink your livers what are going for to do Would ye stiffen your timbers go for to be such poltroons as to brush the jackets of a parcel of naked men Dont you see they have canted away their whackers
Then speaking in a lower tone to his lieutenant general—said he
The shew is over we must let down the rug so do you parley to the hearties while I palaver the old rum kid yonder
Upon this he came up to Sir Sidney and was beginning to state the case in a very advantageous way to his master and himself when their attention was drawn off by a violent screaming at a short distance Directing their eyes to where the sound proceeded from they saw a coach overturned to which Sir Sidney ran and was indeed followed by the whole mob friends and enemies
The coach belonged to Major Malplaquet and there were in it at the time of this accident that gentleman his lady and the reverend Mr Standfast Neither the lady nor the curate received any material injury but the majors head had pitched against a ragged stone by which means his skull was dangerously fractured
The combatants their cause of quarrel and every other consideration was now absorbed in this melancholy accident
The major was with difficulty listed into his coach where Sir Sidney who had never seen him before offered to accompany him recommending his chaise to Mrs Malplaquet into which Mr Standfast very politely offered to accompany her with a view as he said of keeping up her spirits
The lady however thought proper to refuse both offers and insisted upon going with her husband She however did not neglect to thank Sir Sidney with tears for his kind concern which indeed was as manifest as if the wounded person had been his own brother for he had by this time dispatched three servants to different surgeons Not but Mr Standfast appeared in some concern too but the glances he cast at the lady and the opera tune he softly whistled while he assisted his dying patron pretty well evinced that his mind ran rather upon the future than the present
Sir Sidney would not leave the major a moment but supported him in the coach with the utmost care and tenderness all the way home where by the time they arrived and the major was put to bed arrived also two of the surgeons who agreed that the major had not many hours to live They however bled him prepared bandages and one of them began to prepare for the operation of the trepan resolved that their patient should go out of the world
secundum artem
They were however disappointed for falling into a delirium he erupted a blood vessel—which one of the surgeons very judiciously observed must have been injured by the fall—and was instantly suffocated
Mrs Malplaquet did not faint away nor even go into hysterics upon this occasion she felt however very severely It is true her tears did not prevent her from thanking Sir Sidney on the contrary she acknowledged his singular goodness in terms of the most lively gratitude yet her grief though it appeared only decent and proper was from the heart She no more than the vicar would have wished the destruction of the vilest reptile and though she never regarded the major with the ardour of love yet he had ever been kind and she grateful
I shall pass over the funeral at which Sir Sidney by a particular invitation from Mrs Malplaquet was present and only say that when all proper ceremonies and decent solemnities were over the widow after paying some legacies—the principal of which was three thousand pounds to the Reverend Mr Standfast as a trifling acknowledgment of his disinterested and honourable attachment—for the chaplain had frequently hinted that if a man left any thing to a friend it had better be in money which would prevent litigation The widow I say after discharging these obligations found herself in the possession of a plentiful fortune
One circumstance however I must not fail to mention which is that Mr Mildman at the desire of Mrs Malplaquet preached the funeral sermon Nor can I avoid noticing that Sir Sidney furnished the epitaph which was no more than what follows
HERE are deposited the Remains of MAJOR MALPLAQUET Who feared his Maker Served his Country And left a grateful Widow to lament his Death And celebrate his inferior Virtues He died March the st  Aged  Years
This epitaph Emma declared to be perfect in all its requisites for it told who was the person buried and very concisely pointed out his good qualities you also learnt by it when he died and how old he was Nay so much was she pleased that she doubted not if it had been written in latin but that Dr JOHNSON himself must have been perfectly content with it For her part she liked it as well as it was and that for a very good reason as she humbly conceived namely because she did not understand latin Indeed she owned that this was one of the spots that candour obliged her to acknowledge were now and then to be discovered in the doctor He was very angry that Dr SMOLLETs epitaph was not written in latin and when he went into an apothecarys shop with Mr BOSWELL instead of asking for some trifling medicine he had occasion for he called for paper pen and ink and wrote it down in latin
These manners and opinions she thought—for nobody was so open to conviction as Emma—were upon erudition what rust is upon a coin which no one knows the value of but the possessor
Nothing could be so clear she said as what she advanced It was not every bodys lot to be blest with so much learning as the doctor which she maintained was very fortunate for if all men were arrived at such perfection as himself and were able like him of advancing incontrovertible
ipse dixits
argument would be at an end and of course literature along with it But as he was the only one who had ever pretended to be infallible and who certainly was so except in a few trifling points like this it might so happen that latin epitaphs would prove a sarcasm where they were meant to be a panegyric for to praise a dead person in a language he was unacquainted with while living though a tacit would be a very strong satire besides being a cruel inconvenience to his family who must in this case be obliged to get the parson to construe the virtues of the deceased who after all perhaps might not be able to do it off hand She therefore clearly apprehended that as Dr JOHNSON had issued a literary bill enacting that an epitaph could not be perfect which did not mention the particulars before rehearsed the next infallible writer—if ever this country should be blest with another should be petitioned to move by way of rider that for the benefit of the public in general all such epitaphs should be done in English
But said she finishing her harrangue dear Doctor JOHNSON put me in mind at last of DOMITIUS AFER who would be an orator when he could no longer be audible and of whom QUINTILIAN said that he would rather sail than desist
It is now high time I should account for that strange jumble of accidents which in so short a time saved an hundred men from bodily hurt and yet killed another who had no concern at all in the fray
The reader will recollect that Standfast had a scheme in agitation It was this He knew Mrs Malplaquet to be of a most tender and compassionate temper and he thought he could wound her through this weak side He had therefore lured the major and her out by way of an afternoons ride intending when they arrived at the field of battle to exclaim against the barbarity of the disputants to jump out of the carriage and to insist on their going peaceably home
This he thought the lady would take in such a light as must greatly forward his designs The contemplation of this scheme on his side and the hopes of detecting him on the side of Mrs Malplaquet made them on that afternoon better satisfied with each other than they had been a long time and gave the major such real pleasure that he declared as they were in the carriage that he never passed so happy a day in his life without divining poor man that it would be his last
Mr Standfasts kind intentions were however forestalled by Sir Sidney who through an unexpected dissolution of parliament was posting down to be rechosen for the borough of Neitherside
Thus are men saved or destroyed by the turn of a straw Thus the villagers slept in whole skins thus the major was hurried into the other world thus were the designs of Mr Standfast frustrated and thus—for I cannot longer refrain from declaring it—did Sir Sidney see that phantom we formerly spoke of that disturber of his peace to whom he longed to open his mind
This is the secret I hinted to the reader at the end of the sixth chapter and I only desire to be resolved had I then divulged it—and thereby have neglected to bring him acquainted with the heartburnings of the two villages the contrast between the two parsons the singular friendship of Standfast and the major the amiable cast of Mrs Malplaquet the extraordinary qualities of her maid the wonderful and surprising talents of Mr Flush and every other person or thing that conduced to bring about that event which introduced Sir Sidney to Mrs Malplaquet—whether it would not have been doing things in a bungling and unworkmanlike manner
Besides I have now no further trouble with these people the reader is perfectly acquainted with them and if in future they should be thrown in his way let them speak for themselves
To be sure had they never appeared at all Sir Sidney might have been heart-whole but since a number of circumstances are likely to grow out of this accidental interview I have even given it as it happened and shall now tell the reader when time had fully confirmed the baronet in his first opinion of the widow that she was a very handsome and what was more to him a very valuable woman he resolved to throw his fortune into her lap and his person into her arms and for this purpose he was determined to make her a proposal to that effect as soon as decency should permit it
Several reasons urged him to this first there was a secret which to make amends for my late transgression shall be almost immediately disclosed to the reader
Perhaps my readiness to indulge him may be attributed to malevolence because in doing so I shall be obliged to shew a speck in the character of Sir Sidney which to some may appear black place it in what light I will To this accusation however I plead not guilty solemnly declaring that in the most unrighteous moments of his life I truly believe he had as reasonable a stock of piety as any bishop would desire as much temperance soberness and chastity even in his very excesses as a gouty alderman under a regimen and at any rate as little desire of doing an injury to man woman or child as a Lord Chancellor
This however need not hinder the reader from exercising his own judgment which I not only desire he may do but also with the most critical care and nicety and when all the circumstances dangers temptations motives and inducements are clearly and fairly examined if he should not acquit Sir Sidney of every thing worse than venial frailty I must honestly take shame to myself for having palmed on the world as an exemplary character a mere mortal made up of flesh and blood and subject to wishes inclinations and desires like other men
I could say certainly that the very excellence of Sir Sidneys heart sprung from having as vigorous and turbulent passions as any rake in christendom and never having improperly given them the reins but once in his life But some of my readers may think that once too much And as a blot at backgammon is no blot till it is hit and a blot of ink is the easier discoverable in proportion to the whiteness of the paper on which it falls and as an atom is not only magnified but more deformed by being seen through a microscope so I fear this one fault will intrude itself on the readers remembrance in the very act of relieving distressed genius or wiping a tear from the cheek of an orphan If it should be so I must submit for a reader like a pope is infallible and from his fiat there is no appeal
The story of Sir Sidneys incontinence—for incontinence it was and such things like murder will out—shall be told in the next chapter which will finish the first book of this history and while the reader takes time to consider what heinous crime this can possibly be let me bespeak his charity by informing him that Sir Sidney being once foreman of a grand jury whom the judge recommended to find a bill against a murderer because as he said such and such circumstances were which could not have been yet proved answered with an honest fervour—
My Lord in my opinion the pre-judgment of an offence is half as criminal as the commission of it
CHAPTER XII
WHICH CONTAINS THE TRIAL OF SIR SIDNEY—THE PLEADINGS ON BOTH SIDES—THE VERDICT AND SENTENCE—AND FINISHES THE FIRST BOOK OF THIS HISTORY
WE are now going to enter upon action every thing already related having happened previous to the time when the reader and I entered the rookery or as Mr Bayes has it long before the beginning of this play We there left Sir Sidney apparently possessed of every comfort upon earth and yet unhappy This seeming paradox has been partly accounted for but let us hope as Mrs Malplaquet is now entirely mistress of herself that the bar to the completion of the baronets wishes may be removed
The major has now been dead nearly a twelve-month and Sir Sidney has had many opportunities of confirming himself in the good opinion he originally entertained of the widow but as at his time of life marriage was no maygame he honestly solicited to be acquainted with every secret of her heart frankly offering to encourage her by laying open the exact situation of his own
Mrs Malplaquet liked the proposal so well that she did not hesitate to give him every information concerning herself which I formerly gave the reader not forgetting to own with an ingenuous frankness that she had loved before and though were she to form a character she knew of no quality she would wish to make a part of it that Sir Sidney did not perfectly possess yet that warmth of affection which she had formerly cherished would never again she sincerely believed take place in her heart
Sir Sidney scarcely heard her to an end when he exclaimed—
Madam in opening my own heart I should have used the very same words I have loved and will imitate you by confessing that the object of my affection whether alive or dead is still dear to me Your resemblance of her first induced my admiration of you and the consonance of your sentiments with hers inspired me with an esteem of the truest kind which perhaps in marriage more securely ensures happiness than what is generally called love
To conside in your tender bosom the secret of my passion is now my duty and if you will have the patience to hear me I shall shew you that those who are capable of most tenderness are effectively the least happy—but as old AESOP said when Prometheus took the clay to form man he tempered it with tears
The lady testified great impatience and the baronet proceeded to satisfy her in the following words
Being about ten years ago in the south of France I became acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Le Clerc He had a daughter who at the time I first visited in the family was just come home from a convent Conversations between French and English too often turn on the subject of religion As to Mr Le Clerc he was not satisfied with continually chanting forth the praises of that only and exclusive worship which according to him would procure salvation but he daily exhorted me to embrace his faith
This inconvenience I should have got rid of by renouncing his acquaintance or removing to another town but I had no such power I had spoken you may be assured warmly though not like an enthusiast of our own mild reasonable worship representing it as the true medium between frantic zeal and subtle hypocrisy and though all my arguments served but to root the fathers opinion the stronger I plainly began to perceive I had made a convert of the daughter
In the convent where she boarded lived also several English ladies who had already began to stagger her sentiments—no wonder then her conversion was completed by the man she loved Yes madam plain downright and sincere as I was a beautiful girl of nineteen gentle as a cherub and good as an angel doated on me Nor was I behind hand with her I promise you for my affection was exactly of that sort which receives its pleasure by reflecting what it has given
This was the charm that withheld me We consulted together on the most expedient means to gratify our mutual wishes and though I dreaded the event it was resolved that I should offer myself to her father as the husband of my dear Annette I did so he heard me to an end and then very explicitly informed me that he would consent to my marriage with his daughter upon condition I changed my religion
I spoke of this as an unsurmountable objection when he candidly told me he saw how matters were and would immediately send his daughter to a severer convent to prevent her from throwing herself into the arms of a heretic
I had scarcely returned to my lodgings to reflect on this adventure and the measures I ought to take in consequence of it when my servant came running to tell me that a post chaise was waiting at the door with a lady in it who desired to see me immediately Guess what was my surprize when I beheld my Annette who told me in as few words as possible that her father was at that moment gone to the abbess of a certain convent to agree to her entire exclusion from the world that she had chosen the moment of his absence to come to me and knowing how much my mind was above the false delicacy of sacrificing to ridiculous form and unnecessary ceremony she proposed at once going off for some town where we might be married in the protestant faith
You may be sure I did not hesitate but leaving my affairs to my faithful servant whom I ordered to stay and watch the motions of the enemy I leaped into the chaise and we were more than twenty leagues on our road to Geneva when poor Annette was taken so very ill that it was impossible for us to proceed
I was in hopes her indisposition had proceeded from the fatigue the hurry of her spirits and those fears which were natural upon having taken so precipitate a resolution but I found myself lamentably mistaken her disorder encreased and I was greatly alarmed for her life By degrees however she recovered and though very weak we apprehended no more dangerous symptoms
During all this time as we were thrown among a parcel of boors I was obliged to give her every attendance I decently could This attention procured so free and uninterrupted an intercourse between us that is it wonderful when the rose began to revisit her cheeks and my whole soul was in a trance of happiness at the prospect of retrieving an inestimable treasure that a few days before I had dreaded to lose for ever—Is it wonderful thus unrestrained considering ourselves as man and wife we became so by every tie but the ceremony I will not comment on the circumstance perhaps it was inexcusable perhaps I ought not to have disclosed it but nothing could be purer than our intentions were and I have no opinion of secrets which are revealed after marriage
Mrs Malplaquet—which I think was very handsome in her—scarcely called it a fault because of the peculiarity of their situation and their intention of setting matters honourably to rights Nay she undertook to defend the conduct of the lady at which Sir Sidney was so greatly charmed that he sung forth very lavishly in praise of the widows generosity liberality and candour and declared that except now and then a sigh to the memory of Annette he should never have an intruding care
Well madam returned the baronet three weeks passed in pleasures which it is not in my power to describe At the end of this time my Annette having recovered sufficient strength to undergo the fatigue of her journey we set out for Geneva but scarcely had we got within a league and a half of those frontiers where by exercising the right of a husband I could have silenced the pretensions of a father when being overtaken by a posse of horsemen headed by Le Clerc my Annette was torn from me while I was overpowered and carried before the general of the police of the neighbouring town
This gentleman heard my story to an end laughed at my folly for not getting sooner out of danger took a handsome present of me and gave me a letter to the father of Annette advising him to make up the breach by consenting to our marriage
I scarcely gave myself time for sleep or any other refreshment before I threw myself at the feet of Mr Le Clerc I got nothing from him however but a volley of reproaches to which I answered that his daughter was affianced to me that I considered her as my wife and would employ my whole fortune as well as the interest of the English embassador who was my particular friend to do myself justice
Every argument procured me a new insult I therefore went to Paris for the purpose of consulting my friend the embassador but as we were then upon the eve of a war and he expected every moment to be recalled it was out of his power to do me any service
Thus disappointed I returned once more to Provence There I found Le Clerc ten times more furious than ever He loaded me with a thousand invectives It had it seems been found out that Annette was with child and he swore he would rather see her expire than that she should bring a heretic into the world Vainly I represented to him that he was now compelled by every motive of honour and justice to make us one He vowed my destruction
After hovering about the place for a considerable while—employing every emissary my purse could procure to trace out where they had sequestered Annette—and having learnt no more than that she was admitted into a convent at a considerable distance till she should lie in upon condition of taking the veil immediately afterwards I was musing one day what further course to pursue when my servant came running in with the greatest horror pictured in his countenance and told me if I did not immediately fly I should be imprisoned for life for that his dear lady—so he always called Annette—had died in childbed after bringing forth a girl and that her father out of revenge had procured a
lettre de cachet
against my person
Shocked as I was at this fatal news I did not however neglect my safety to which I was not a little prompted by a lively desire to succour the little innocent pledge of our tender affection I therefore followed my man through a back field mounted a horse of my own—for I feared to go post—and made the best of my way towards Savoy
On the road my man informed me that the postilion who drove us to the house where Annette was taken ill happened to set a company down at Provence some time afterwards where being told among other things of the bustle Le Clerc had made in searching after his daughter to no purpose began to be convinced by putting different circumstances together that it must be her he had driven in my company for it had been explained to him that she had gone off with an English gentleman In hopes therefore of a bribe on the other side he went to Le Clerc confessed to him where he had taken us informed him of Annettes illness and assured him that as we talked of going to Geneva if he could not overtake us there was a great chance of catching us as we returned especially if we went to that house for as we must have stopt there some time they would at any rate be able to give a good account of us
Le Clerc did not hesitate a moment but set out with two friends and a party of the
Marechause
 who came to the inn
ome hours after we had left it There they got every intelligence they wanted and quickening their diligence they soon overtook us as I have already described
My servant also told me that he did not believe a syllable of Annettes death His real opinion was that she had taken the veil for that it was a very common thing for their friends to give out whenever that event took place that they were dead to prevent troublesome importunity and in the present instance it was extremely probable because could I have found out the convent to which she was devoted I should have left nothing untried to shake that vow which I was sure she never would have taken but by compulsion
And for heavens sake said the widow what is become of the child
She is well madam—answered the baronet
But where said the widow
At a school about twenty miles off replied Sir Sidney
You astonish me replied she How did you preserve her
You shall hear said the baronet
Having left respectable connections in Provence I received intelligence from thence that very soon after I left France Le Clerc quitted that part of the kingdom but they never could hear to what place he retired About two years afterwards—no longer apprehending any ill consequences from the
lettre de cachet—
I went again to Provence but however had my journey for my pains
Three other visits were made with no better success Last year however I was more fortunate for I had not been many days in the town before a nun of the order of St Clare called at my friends house and demanded to speak to me—She informed me that her order being one of those which are allowed to have intercourse at certain times with the world she was desired by an abbess of another convent to let me know that my child would be delivered up to me
You may believe I was charmed with this intelligence I went with her to the convent where I enquired very earnestly for Annette but they confirmed every thing I had before heard Nay I was even shewn her grave which you may be assured I watered with my tears In short I came away bringing with me her living model who I sincerely believe was not out of my arms an hour at a time till my arrival in Warwickshire
Your doubts after this subsided I suppose cried the widow
I cannot say they did returned the baronet the little creature at this moment talks of Madame Le Clerc whom she used to call mamma in a great house like a church I therefore think my being shewn the grave was a religious fraud invented to deter me from searching for her in vain
She is certainly irrecoverably gone and therefore dead to me No I shall never forget her but let me not forget myself Providence permitted this separation perhaps to punish us for the crime of having impetuously gratified our wishes before they received the sanction of religion It is a heavy punishment but I will not incur a greater by repining
Here Sir Sidney paused Several parts of his narrative were recapitulated and a variety of reflections grew out of them on the instability of human expectations Sir Sidney apologized to Mrs Malplaquet for having so freely opened his heart to her and she sincerely assured him it had considerably augmented her esteem for him
I shall not trouble the reader with his reply or her rejoinder but only say that after a number of civil things had passed on both sides he reminded her that he wanted a mother for his child and she without affectation at length promised to undertake that task
In a word she shortly after became Lady Roebuck to the great satisfaction of the baronet the confusion of Standfast and the universal joy of Castlewick
END OF THE FIRST BOOK
THE YOUNGER BROTHER
BOOK II
WHICH IS STILL MORE INTERESTING THAN THE FORMER
CHAPTER I
A CLEARING OF THE COURSE PREPARATORY TO THE NEXT HEAT
As a variety of circumstances—many of them very unexpectedly—will shortly present themselves to the reader I think it necessary as far as I may conceive it our mutual interest to prepare him for their reception Indeed it is my intention to adopt this practice frequently in the course of this history not in such a way however as to anticipate any thing Nay I will not promise that these explanations shall always be literally what they seem for should I wish to cover or disguise any circumstance till the proper moment of making it known I hope he will not be angry if I put him a little upon a false scent by way of exercise to get him an appetite to the real game when at last he shall come up with it
I beg however it may be understood that these false lights are not intended unnecessarily to lead him astray I know this literary Will o th Wisp is often introduced but I disclaim it as an unpardonable and impotent attempt at a spurious wit which is really an affront to every intelligent reader So much indeed do I hold such sort of trifling a thing that ought on no account to be excused that I desire this work may be considered perfect only in proportion as every circumstance even the most minute and apparently insignificant tends to promote the general effect and that effect holds out a laudable and improving moral
We have heard very little of Standfast since the death of Major Malplaquet This worthy wight which will be very little doubted laid strong siege to the widow for as I said before she became at her husbands decease very wealthy She however having nobody to please but herself gave him such a reception as soon convinced him that his hopes were like some of the projects of our late builders—fair and elegantly finished in the estimate but mere skeletons in practice
Thus disappointed he pocketed his trifle as he called the three thousand pounds and decamped contenting himself with whispering that he might very easily have married the widow if he had thought proper but knowing ones were not to be taken in that women who would sip in the time of their first husbands might taste when they got a second and that perhaps had he been fool enough to be caught he might have doated too and so have gotten a lusty chaplain to help him out as somebody else did
These gross jokes were faithfully retailed by Mr Flush Not however without a finish that if the governor—meaning Standfast—had braced the drum of matrimony a certain genteel dapper cock of an humble servant of his would not have feared coming in for a trevally or so
I have never told the reader that Mr Standfast and Mr Viney were very intimate friends and perhaps he has divined why if not he will presently The fact however was so They had known each other for several years and indeed upon Vineys being civilly dismissed from Lord Hazards house he consulted Standfast whom he well knew to be a perfect Machiavel in domestic politics upon the likeliest means to preserve his declining interest in that family
The stream of Standfasts interest going at that time in another channel nothing came of the negociation but the major being dead and he expelled from the presence of the widow the two friends finding themselves in the same situation and that the interest of one was the interest of both they laid their heads together and considered of the matter in every point of view At length they agreed that nothing could so perfectly answer their several wishes as to get Standfast into Lord Hazards family Take their own words
It is such a damned good scheme said Standfast that I envy you for thinking on it but I am devlishly afraid it is not practicable
You are right cried Viney let us tread sure Go on warily I know his foibles that is one thing in our favour
How is he for a first sight attack said Standfast
A very dove cried Viney a greenhorn
That is lucky said Standfast we have nothing then to consider of but the introduction Does he know any thing of me
Only by hearsay replied Viney and now I recollect what he did hear was to your advantage Let me see what was it Oh that the major out of his great friendship had left you considerably and in particular had commanded his lady on his death bed to take you for her second husband
Ridiculous cried Standfast the old fellow never spoke after the accident and as to the widow my dear Sir she was too peery No no nothing less than the title of my lady would content her
Odso said Viney I wonder at it too You used to be pretty sure of your mark when the doe was to be struck Ha ha ha
True true cried Standfast but this was so skittish she would have taken more powder and shot as well as patience than I would spare upon any such doe were she the transformation of a goddess Hang her let her go She has enough to say against me but if she prattles we must retaliate right or wrong
That to be sure said Viney is but self-defence but to our business Lord Hazard is now seeking out a tutor for his favourite Charles and I own I should like to gall him there Hey my friend am I not right There I feel my sisters injuries
Well hit faith cried Standfast—They tell me it is a fine mettled boy I will bring him up well
Not so fast interrupted Viney In the first place did he know of our intimacy it would be an immoveable bar to our design and then he is determined to receive none but an exemplary character
Me again exclaimed Standfast I will give him examples of pleasure that might resuscitate old Anacreon that is to say behind his fathers back and lessons of morality before his face that might be heard and approved by listening angels
But still our intimacy said Viney
We must get over that replied Standfast Let me see—I have it—cant I introduce myself to some family in town—or make my court to any relation of the wife Zounds now I recollect there is a capital house in the city—Ingot the wire-drawer—where they make me very welcome Lord Hazard occasionally banks there If I can but get recommended to preach two or three charity sermons and afterwards invited to dine with the stewards the business is done I am sure Mr Ingot is under obligations enow to me for I so did up his elder brother by making him genteel that in consequence of two or three genteel
faux
pas
he at last genteelly finished himself by which this remaining brother got to be head of the firm and so you see Viney one good turn deserves another
True true said Viney
So said so done Standfast left a friend to officiate for him at Little Hockley and repaired to town where he so well set his engines to work that in six months he not only got introduced to Lord Hazard but contrived so to sustain the several essays made on his disposition and abilities that he issued from that ordeal through which the reader may remember my lord was determined his sons tutor should pass so perfect as to fix himself securely in that noblemans good opinion and indeed—which I should not think it necessary to set down but by way of regularity—Mr Standfast was the very gentleman introduced to Lady Hazard in the fourth chapter of the first book in quality of tutor to her son
If the reader should wonder how it came to pass that Lord Hazard did not know the irregularities of Standfast especially as one was curate of Little Hockley and the other landlord I must inform him that his lordship had never visited his estate in Warwickshire but once after his second marriage but repaired to a villa about twenty miles from London which he bought soon after he came of age Indeed as soon as he determined to give over his excesses Little Hockley was the last place upon earth he wished to think of His rents were punctually remitted and this was all he ever would hear upon the subject
Neither his reformation however nor this caution altered his character in the opinion of the villagers for as the sons and daughters of Little Hockley were many of them of his getting and the rest very ambitious to be thought so they never dreamt that he had any virtues but remembered his vices only glorying in them and speaking of them in so familiar and shameless a manner as if every meal they tasted was the sweeter for being garnished with the bread of dishonour
I will not suppose my reader to be so inexperienced as to think that Standfasts views were merely confined to his intention of becoming the tutor of Charles nor on the other hand will I believe him so sagacious as to discover what they really were—We can scarcely credit that a man of this worthy clergymans consummate experience in human traffic had not a material point to carry especially now he was in partnership with Viney If it was so it will certainly come in its proper place which unless I had a wish—which I really have not—to destroy the readers pleasure cannot possibly be here
Having fixed Mr Standfast in the family of Lord Hazard we will now speak of Mr Flush That valiant thumper of parchment having received a handsome sum and a long lesson from his quondam master was transferred through Viney to the original Lady Hazard now reduced to Mrs OShocknesy and by her again transferred to her son at college
I shall also say that Mrs OShocknesy was present at one or two of the latter consultations relative to the grand business nor indeed was Flush absolutely left out It was on the contrary found necessary to let him partially into the matter for said he very archly
If you dont let me into the maxim of the thing how the devil shall I be able to move your figures for you
A letter from Flush to Standfast after he had been six months at Eton shall finish this chapter—I shall give it the reader in his own words
TO HIS HONOUR THE REV STEPHEN STANDFAST ESQ
GOVERNOR
The young one begins to be up to most things but his book and yet lord love you give him but a tippling gig and an arm full of red and white and such crackers as I and your honour could wind him about our fingers as easily as a bunch of slangs I gave my soft master tother day a trifling bit of a rap about the country ken but Neddy seems all to go with the old Nan Howsomdever I bent one of them thats easily revulsed if he wont go by an exercise I must beat up a charge See ony puss poing ony gain poing as we say abroad Oh revawr my shire mater
Yours tell death K FLUSH
Notey beney Whatever gait you morrice take the advice of a fool and never think any more of ploughing with the heffer
Generals have been known to settle with their aid de camps a kind of characters so unintelligible to any but themselves that should information fall into the enemys hand no ill consequence could ensue One would think Standfast and Flush had made this same agreement In truth did I believe the reader could make Kiddys letter into English I should not have inserted it As it is I shall leave it by way of aenigma which he may either stay and solve or go on to the next chapter and so leave the explanation of that and every thing else to what I may conceive the proper season for it
I would nevertheless have that as well as many other particulars in this chapter carefully attended to Gangrenes begin by a small spot and the egg of a crocodile has as inoffensive an appearance as that of a goose
CHAPTER II
IN WHICH THE GAME BEGINS
Mr STANDFAST no sooner sat down in Lord Hazards family than like a spy in an enemys camp he began to reconnoitre its situation strength and disposition to examine whether the body was well united whether there were any rotten members whether centinels dared to sleep on their posts whether the commanding officer was most loved or feared—In short to use his own words—though I would not have the reader infer from thence that he was a cobler in his business—he had the length of every foot in the family
Not however to be outdone in courtesy there was not one among them that had not something to say in his favour My Lord declared he was a man of strong intellects and sound erudition He did not think him a saint nor wish him to be one Solid argument for ought he could see might as well be discussed over a glass as a lamp and as to gaiety and carelessness he dreaded nothing from them for they could harbour no ill designs He was a little surprised at hearing from Standfast that he had been frequently in his life taken in but it gave him an opportunity of exercising his sagacity by remarking that those who mix most with the world know least of it—as it was said of Lord ANSON after he had been a prey to sharpers that he had been over the world but never in it Upon the whole he thought Mr Standfast a fair undesigning man and both a proper tutor for his son and companion for himself
Lady Hazard was no less prepossessed in favour of the tutor She looked upon him as an unaffected cheerful man perfectly well bred and as she saw his being in the house gave her lord particular satisfaction really felicitated herself upon this acquisition to the family
The butler liked him for though he could well distinguish the different qualities of the wine yet he never made use of his knowledge to a poor servants disadvantage In short there was not a person in the family whose good opinion he had not been anxious to procure and one would have thought with more care and industry than belonged to such a trifle for he so succeeded that he was allowed to be a true servants friend
Mr Standfast had certainly no Iago to egg him on He knew however as well as that subtle gentleman himself that trifles light as air in cases of art are of great use and he doubted not but they would as much conduce to answer the purposes of one kind of hypocrisy as another
As to the pupil he loved Standfast like a father and took instructions from him full as fast as the other could give it which between ourselves not a little embarrassed the tutor who begging Lord Hazards pardon was not so profound a scholar as that kind patron in his liberal warmth had represented him
Standfast feeling this deficiency pressed his lordship to carry his scheme into execution of having Charles taught music and painting thinking and very rightly that relieved by those avocations he should be able to make his stock of learning last as long as he might have occasion for it
Having worked his materials into a proper temper Mr Standfast now began to think of moulding them to his different purposes but this required the nicest care and circumspection My Lord plumed himself upon being no novice and Lady Hazards amiable heart and unconquerable duty barred all possibility of flattering the most distant hopes had there been any such conceived of staggering her virtue or even her prudence
Something Mr Standfast was certainly hatching up and while it was in contemplation a most singular circumstance happened which that gentleman did not fail to lay up as food for his project
Lord and Lady Hazard were one night in a side box at the playhouse where behind them sat a lady and two gentlemen one of whom the fair one often called brother and the other Sir Daniel At the end of the amusement while they were waiting for their carriage one of these gentlemen seeing a person go out of the opposite box exclaimed
there he goes and by God Ill be after him
Immediately upon this he darted out of the box followed by the other who warmly entreated him not to be precipitate Almost at the same moment the lady shrieked out
Good God there will be murder
and immediately fainted away
Neither the good offices of Lord Hazard nor his lady were wanting to restore her which desirable event they at length happily achieved The lady now begged for heavens sake he would have the goodness to conduct her to her coach which entreaty
Lady Hazard seconded with all her eloquence—Upon this the ladys footman from the lobby summoned the coach to the door and my lord having very politely seen her into it returned with an intention to join Lady Hazard In his way he encountered one of the gentlemen he had seen in the box who accosted him with
I must thank you Sir for the civility you have done me
Sir answered Lord Hazard with great politeness if you mean in respect to any attention shewn to the lady it was but my duty and I am already thanked
I dare say you are replied the other but that wont go down with me In short you are a scoundrel and I insist upon deciding the matter immediately it can be done in this tavern—
Sir said Lord Hazard very spiritedly I do not think myself obliged to answer so unprovoked and rude an assault but as every thing in your appearance except this insult calls you gentleman I attend you Sir
At this moment Standfast who had been at the other theatre and had by promise returned to go home with Lord Hazard came up and boldly enquired who it was that dared to insult that nobleman—upon which a crowd having gathered about the cry was
settle it in the tavern—settle it in the tavern
There they now adjourned but not before Lord Hazard had dispatched Standfast to his lady to request that she would stay for that he should be immediately with her
When they were come to the place of explanation Lord Hazard was more at a loss than ever—The gentleman who had insulted him brought against him a direct accusation of carrying on a clandestine correspondence with his sister which he said was doubly dishonourable as she was at the point of marriage to a worthy young baronet
This charge was parried by a declaration that till the present evening the lord had never seen the lady but the brother treated this excuse with contempt and was for fighting it out instantly mixing his invectives with some insinuations about a masquerade The company however opposed his warmth and the clamour was so various and violent that nothing distinctly could be understood It was therefore determined as with one voice that the affair should not then be decided but as it seemed a matter of delicacy the disputants should privately exchange addresses and meet with each a friend to talk the business over in the morning This was immediately complied with and now arrived Standfast with news that Lady Hazard had quitted the boxes and he supposed was gone home
Lord Hazard and Standfast betook themselves to a hackney coach in which on their way the latter was made acquainted as far as my lord knew it with this mysterious business Standfast said it must have originated in some mistake which he supposed would be cleared up on the morrow for added he
you never saw the lady before did you my lord
Never in my life said Lord Hazard
Nay said Standfast if you had the fellow need not have made such a piece of work about it for I am very much mistaken or she is one of the right sort and very likely the brother is only a led knight employed to bully in her cause therefore were I your lordship I would take care if I must be forced into a duel it should be with a gentleman
My Lord declared that he most sincerely believed the lady was a woman of honour for said he
I never saw more unaffected signs of modesty As to the brother I think with you that the whole matter will prove a mistake and the affair blow over
You know my lord cried Standfast I always yield to you in matters of experience however we shall see for I hope I am to have the honour of accompanying your lordship to-morrow
Why I was thinking so too said my lord but as the gentleman may unfortunately happen to call in my absence and as it would be a kind of tacit reflection on my honour if he should go away unsatisfied I will get you to stay and receive him I hope however to prevent his coming for I shall be out very early to convince him that I am as anxious to bring this business to a finish as himself As to a second you know if it should be necessary I can take our friend Colonel Tiltly
They now arrived at Lord Hazards house where they found my lady who informed them that having stayed till there was no soul in the theatre but herself she prevailed on the box-keeper to find her servants and see her to her coach
But my lord said she what could possibly detain you
Lord Hazard who had never considered that this question would certainly be asked him was totally unprepared to answer it After some hesitation however he faultered out in great apparent confusion
Nay not the lady I assure you my love
I did not know but she might have had another fit said Lady Hazard in that case it would have been inhumanity to have left her
Why if it had been so replied my lord where would have been the great crime in it
Crime returned her ladyship I had no idea of any such thing Charity is no crime my lord but really your looks accuse you more than I do I appeal to any body if I was a jealous wife whether a stander-by would blame me if I should be suspicious at this moment
Well then upon my honour madam said Lord Hazard I only saw the lady to her coach and was returning to you but a particular business which happened very unexpectedly prevented me This Mr Standfast knows to be truth
Standfast was here beginning a very handsome excuse for his friend when the lady stopt him and addressing herself to my lord said
My dear if you had not made this last declaration if your friend here had not seconded you if I had actually been told that you went home with the lady that she was an old acquaintance of yours and that she came into the box by your appointment I should never have mentioned the subject again—therefore I beg my lord I may not hear of it from you
This is ridiculous said his lordship you conjure up a parcel of imaginary stuff and then argue upon it as if it really existed
God forbid it ever should exist said the lady I only mention it to shew if it really did what a good wife I should be
Supper was now brought in and the subject of course dropt
The three persons concerned in it however did not so easily dismiss it from their thoughts as they had from their tongues They neither eat much supper nor enjoyed much rest and what appears very extraordinary Standfast who one should think was least concerned ruminated on it the most
Perhaps the catastrophe of this adventure may bring out what his cogitations were Those of Lord and Lady Hazard may be very easily guessed I cannot help however remarking that this night was the first they ever slept together without speaking to each other nor did my lord ever before leave his lady so early or so abruptly
If the reader wishes the matter to clear up and that a reconciliation should take place it is more than Mr Standfast did who very archly remarked as he came down stairs in the morning that he must be a bungling physician indeed who did not know how to irritate as well as to cure
CHAPTER III
A CONTINUATION OF THE SAME SPORT
LADY Hazard having been told by my lords gentleman that her husband was gone out and had left word he should not return perhaps till dinner sat down to breakfast with Mr Standfast and her son Charles which meal however was very short for the tutor appeared exceedingly anxious to introduce his pupil to some new author with whom the young gentleman seemed as evidently to wish himself acquainted They therefore retired to the library and left the lady to herself who for some minutes afterwards continued in a profound reverie not knowing what to make of her husbands having gone out so unprecedentedly for as to the adventure of the preceding night she had pretty well made up her mind on it
There was not much time to reflect on that or any thing else before the door opened and a person walked into the room whom Lady Hazard knew immediately for the very same Sir Daniel whom she had seen at the playhouse She was for a moment astonished but recollecting herself she got up and was making her way towards the bell when the gentleman who for some reason or other did not seem to approve of her taking that step got the start of her and disputed the pass
No no my dear madam said he that cannot be you must suffer me to prevent you Besides what would your servants say if you called them about you
Say Sir answered the lady with a look of ineffable disdain one of them was witness to your ruffian-like behaviour last night and would want no order from me to treat you as you merit—which chastisement if you do not wish to provoke you will begone instantly
Not till you have granted my pardon said he By heaven this visit which I have managed to a miracle was meant only as an atonement for my last nights offence Twas madness—liquor—any thing you will
Dare not Sir said the lady to affront my ears with your gross insolence
Nay then cried he there is but a moment and by heaven I will not lose it Charming creature look with pity on me
What do you mean exclaimed Lady Hazard Nay unhand me or Ill raise the house
Never cried the ravisher this minute shall seal my happiness
Heavens cried the lady shall I be treated thus—is there no one near me
Yes madam cried Standfast who entered the room there is one near you and ever ready thus to treat the villain who shall dare to wrong such beauty and innocence
So saying he flew at the ravisher as if he would have throttled him Then pausing—
But hold said he my regard to Lady Hazards character protects you in this house—Tell me who you are and expect me in half an hour at the Smyrna
I am called said the other Sir Daniel Dog-bolt and will not fail you may be assured As to you madam said he I sincerely regret that I have given you a moments pain What a wretch I am—last night—Oh that it had been prosperous or that I could blot it from my memory
Here he left the room and Mr Standfast ringing the bell a servant presently made his appearance who asking if he was wanted was told only to see the gentleman out to which he answered that John had opened the door and the gentleman offered him half a guinea but he would not take it
Very well said Standfast take away the things
which while the servant was doing he whispered to Lady Hazard to compose herself—for she was on a sofa and seemed indeed extremely flurried
When the servant was gone out of the room Standfast advanced to Lady Hazard and said
I should be extremely unhappy if zealous in your ladyships cause I have done any thing in this business contrary to your wishes
Good God cried the lady how can you have such an idea Mr Standfast A ruffian assaulted me and you came to my assistance Can such conduct demand any thing less from me than the warmest thanks
Madam I beg your pardon said Standfast but it has been a strange business altogether I had for one moment—perhaps for which I ought never to be forgiven—forgot the unsullied purity of Lady Hazard and when I heard from the gentleman that insinuation concerning last night—but it is impossible—I see it—he must be a villain I will answer with my life that if ever a heart was the mansion of innocence yours is
I thank you for your opinion sir said the lady I hope I deserve it As to last night I will not make a mystery of it now though I thought I had sufficient reason for it then After my lord left me this bold man came back to the box and seeing me alone began to enquire what was become of the lady I told him that at my desire my lord had conducted her to her coach upon which he said he would remain to thank him for his civility as well as to protect me from any insult—He behaved very properly at first but as the house thinned his conversation took quite a different turn He first said he wondered my lord did not return then said he was surely gone home with the lady and at last assured me that to his knowledge she was an old acquaintance of his At length he ventured at some rude freedoms but at that moment John came to ask me if he should draw off the coach and seeing what passed did not hesitate to treat the ruffian pretty severely for his insolence
Blessings on him for it cried Standfast as well as for refusing the money just now I never thought it of him I confess before but I see he is a noble fellow—but go on madam
I suffered myself said Lady Hazard to be conducted by my servant and the box-keeper to my coach and came home when having cautioned John never to open his lips on the subject I took the resolution of keeping it from my husbands knowledge for fear of his resentment
Nothing could be more commendable certainly said Standfast Insufferable impudence in a public place too a fellow you had never seen before I suppose And then to have recourse to that stale trick of accusing my lord—so worthy a character so good a husband
Heaven forbid I should think him otherwise said the lady but how came this audacious man here Which of the servants could shew him into this apartment
Oh I can account for that said Standfast—
Can you sir said the lady
That is to say answered the tutor I think I can guess You know my lord entrusted me with the business of last night upon which between ourselves he is gone out this morning
Well and what then said the lady a little peevishly
What then cried Standfast really it is so awkward a business to answer you had better not enquire about it for upon my word I am not at liberty to tell you
This is the strangest mystery said the lady—Surely if you know any thing of the matter you can explain to me how this man came here
Why very true returned Standfast as far as it relates to that madam I can have no objection My lord upon going out this morning desired me to receive every person who should call and I suppose as I had not left the breakfast room five minutes when this pretty gentleman was shewn up here—
But still that is very extraordinary said the lady for no servant announced him
Why then certainly he must have been previously shewn into the library said Standfast while Charles and I were in the little study Suppose I ring to know but upon second thoughts I had better not One servant already has been witness of—but however I will quiet him
I cannot think of it said the lady and whatever may be the consequence rather than my conduct should appear so equivocal I am resolved to acquaint my lord with every thing just as it has fallen out
You would not surely be so mad cried Standfast He has quite enough upon his hands about it already I tremble for him at this moment—
Good God said the lady one would think you wanted to drive me distracted Why tremble for him What has he upon his hands
I beg your pardon madam returned Standfast my anxiety my warmth—Oh that I could dissemble like other men this absurd frankness of mine is always leading me into scrapes
Mr Standfast said the lady very earnestly if you have any thing to tell me that regards my happiness—for I now begin to suspect you have—do not keep me in this dreadful suspence if on the contrary my husband has entrusted you with any thing and enjoined you not to inform me convince him of your friendship by shewing you are worthy of his confidence
Good heaven said Standfast where is there such another woman to be found—of such nice prudence—such delicate honour What my lord entrusted me with madam he certainly left to my own discretion However as one would think it implied a wish to conceal every thing from you— and yet a breach of confidence where any thing so valuable as your peace of mind is concerned would—
By no means interrupted the lady nothing could induce you to forgive yourself—
But my dear madam cried Standfast finding her curiosity so tardy the thing cannot remain a secret the newspapers will be full of it
Well Sir cried the lady it will then be time enough to tell me what I now plainly see will make me wretched whenever I know it
I may not live perhaps till then madam said Standfast
Not live said Lady Hazard what do you mean
Surely you forget my appointment said Standfast with the gentleman at the Smyrna
You will not be so mad cried she
How returned Standfast my honour is engaged and in your cause Adieu and if I should fall do me the justice to reflect that my last moments were spent in your service
So saying he ran precipitately down stairs regardless of Lady Hazard who several times called after him to return She now summoned John into her presence told him to go immediately to the Smyrna coffee-house and desire in her name that Mr Standfast would come back and that if he saw any mischief going on to call any assistance he could to prevent it
John was scarcely out of sight when Lady Hazard reflected what a strange errand she had sent him on and was about to ring the bell to dispatch another servant after him when she recollected this would be only making bad worse
Thus situated it is impossible to describe what she felt Anger for my lord—compassion for Standfast—fear for herself intruded all at once on her gentle mind and yet she knew not why
In the midst of this contention she sought for her son with a view in his conversation to alleviate her uneasiness when going into the library the first object that struck her was Lord Hazard who had gone there in search of Standfast Nothing could equal their mutual surprise out of which my lord first recovering himself said
So madam I am come home you see
Yes said the lady and before dinner too
Well cried my lord are you not obliged to me
My Lord said Lady Hazard I shall never think myself obliged to you for any conduct of which I dont know the motive
Pshaw cried my lord you know I hate discontent
And I dissimulation said the lady
They were going on in this manner when Charles came into the room with a book
Oh madam said he are you here Where is Mr Standfast I came to shew him the prettiest thing I ever met with in my life Shall I read it my lord
I am in no reading mood at present said Lord Hazard
Read it to me my love answered the lady
Charles answered with strong indications of surprise at the looks of his parents
I would read it to you but it is in Greek however I will tell you the sense of it It is an allegorical allusion to the polity of either a kingdom or a family and given in the way of advice by a sage to a king who had quarrelled with his subjects
There was a river says the author that delighted to expand its smooth surface to the beams of the sun Its banks were embossed with verdure it nourished myriads of scaly inhabitants and it glided through the meadows with a placid and majestic grandeur to the surprise and delight of every beholder An unexpected cataract from a neighbouring mountain on a sudden dimmed its lustre and ruffled its tranquillity till hurried by the overbearing conflux it forced itself into two distinct channels—there murmuring it bemoaned its sad and vagrant fate At last each stream as if by joint consent burst the banks which separated them and they met together in affectionate reconcilement no more to part till divided by the ocean
Thus says our author after intestine broils may every kingdom or family endeared by love and loyalty unite and never separate till received into the bosom of fate
CHAPTER IV
MATTER OF THE SAME COMPLEXION
CHARLES having finished his allegory asked his parents how they liked it Lord Hazard said he believed there were very few kingdoms or families either that were not subject to such cataracts—Charles answered it must then be mismanagement in not properly guarding against them
You are right my dear said his mother but what can be done with inundations that force their way like miners in a town and do mischief in proportion as their source is concealed
Perhaps my lord took this as something meant at him for looking very earnestly at his lady he said
you are wonderfully sagacious madam
and then turning to his son asked what he had done with Mr Standfast
Here John entered the library saying
Madam I went as your ladyship ordered me but they were gone
Oh said the lady in great apparent confusion ta—tis—very well John—and when does her ladyship—
Ladyship answered John first looking at Lord Hazard and then at his lady—
But you say they were gone returned the lady
Well tell Frill I am going to my dressing room
Yes my lady said John and retired
Lord continued Lady Hazard what could I be thinking about
What indeed said my lord Something one would imagine not altogether so ingenuous by your evident embarrassment
My embarrassment answered she recollecting herself and then gathering strength from the consciousness of her integrity no my lord there is nothing disingenuous in me as you shall very easily be convinced when you have shewn me all that passes in your own heart
So saying she left the room
In my heart muttered my lord Why zounds
—but seeing Charles he restrained himself Then endeavouring to give the matter a different turn said with a forced smile
I suppose your mother is angry at my going out to breakfast this morning She would be prudent however not to threaten me
Here Mr Standfast came into the room and the moment my lord saw him he exclaimed
here I am sound
And safe I hope my lord said Standfast
I dont know that answered the patron but come with me I have a great deal to tell you
The lord and the tutor now walked out of the room and Charles returned to his study not however without telling Mr Standfast he would not allow him to play truant in that manner
The lord told his friend as soon as they were in a room by themselves that not finding Colonel Tiltly at home he had been to Mr Snaffles house alone where he was surprised to find that gentleman had been gone out about an hour it being then pretty early
and as I knew continued my lord that if he came you would give him a proper answer I sat down to wait his return I had scarcely been there five minutes before his sister came in Seeing a stranger as she imagined she would have retired but presently recollecting me she paid me some well-bred acknowledgments for the attention I had the pleasure of paying her last night I answered this civility and gave my visit a turn of enquiring after her health complimenting her at the same time on the little prejudice her fears had done her complexion She lamented her brother was not at home but added that she expected him every minute and begged I would take breakfast
Though I knew my hot-headed gentleman would only be still more exasperated at finding me tete a tete with his sister I resolved to accept her invitation nor do I repent of my resolution for I confess to you I never met with a woman more unaffectedly captivating You know Standfast I like a sincere candid openness of behaviour and it was never more strongly manifested than in the sweet manner of this lovely young creature
In the course of our conversation on the adventure of yesterday evening I learnt the real cause of that strange medley of circumstances which introduced a coolness for the first time between my wife and me gave me a fresh proof of thy kind attachment—here Standfast bowed—and brought me in company with the most lovely woman my eyes ever beheld
I was astonished to find myself a great deal more concerned in this business than I imagined though poor thing she little knew it but told me the matter as if to an indifferent person imagining my conduct last night demanded from her every explanation
You must know this brother of hers is rigidly tenacious of his sisters honour for he lies under very great obligations to this baronet who is shortly to be married to her and she on her side partakes so strongly of his generosity that she consents to give her hand to a man she cannot love to pay her brothers debt of gratitude
She told you all this did she my lord said Sandfast
Oh yes answered my lord she has none of that sordid narrowness of mind the result of vulgar sentiments and mean education She is all candour and frankness Oh you may see in a moment she has maintained a high rank in society
Well you have been told that the brother very abruptly left his sister and her intended husband in the box and sallied after a gentleman whom he saw coming out on the opposite side This man it seems paid some attention to this sweet girl and was insulting enough knowing their circumstances to propose a settlement This the brother resented and a duel was the consequence but no alarming issue came of it for after a mutual discharge of pistols the seconds interfered and upon a promise given by this gentleman that he would never more presume to address Miss Snaffle all anger subsided Last week however at the masquerade if you recollect you and I paid particular attention to a lovely figure in the dress of a circassian and to confess the truth while you were gone to see after our party I made no scruple to be very free with her seeing her entirely alone and believing her to be one of the frail sisterhood She says indeed I took a number of indecent liberties and faith the fact might be so for we had been drinking a great deal of champaigne All this Miss Snaffle—for you have seen she was the circassian—related to her brother when he returned from seeing after their carriage
The brother immediately sought after me directed by the description of my dress all over the rooms and I dare say we should have had a tilting bout that evening had I not upon joining you yielded to your pressing entreaty to return home
Not finding me they had nothing now for it but conjecture who it could be that had so publicly insulted the lady The suspicion naturally lighted on the gentleman who had before affronted her by his offer of a settlement Mr Snaffle therefore immediately determined upon an explanation with him whenever they should meet The first time he saw him was last night at the play where he joined him in that sudden manner you have heard of and they went together into the Shakespear Here a very singular explanation took place the gentleman informed Mr Snaffle that he had religiously adhered to the promise made at the conclusion of their quarrel that however he was entirely devoted to the lady and meant to make her honourable proposals the moment he should by the death of a very near relation be released from the restraint which till that event happened would prevent his having so much happiness that being nevertheless unalterably attached to her he determined as far as he decently could to watch her inclinations and being that evening at the masquerade and noticing the particular conduct of a gentleman there—meaning me—had the curiosity to enquire who that gentleman was in which he so well succeeded that I was described as a reformed rake who had married after ruining a whole village
Thus you see Mr Snaffle being told all these particulars no wonder he should accost me in the extraordinary manner he did or that I should find it necessary to make the handsomest apology for my conduct which I was on the point of doing when I considered how awkward it would be to announce myself Besides it would then have been necessary to inform the lady of the quarrel which it was easy to see had been carefully concealed from her And again I did not know whether an apology to her might satisfy her brother Besides to be ingenuous if I had made a concession and taken my leave it was possible I might never see her again All these considerations determined me still to conceal myself so after a thousand acknowledgments for her condescension I left a message for the brother and hastened home to consult thee
Well my lord said Standfast I have heard you to an end and once more I caution you not to be imposed upon In the first place it is a very curious thing that the lady this morning should relate her love her poverty and her gratitude and the Lord knows what to a gentleman she never saw till last night It puts me too much in mind of one of the histories of those unfortunate poor devils who always begin with—I was a clergymans daughter
Faith said my lord scarcely attending to Standfast there was one thing escaped her that charmed me Said she—I wish I had not gone to that masquerade or else that this lord was not married and a rake
Good God cried Standfast cannot you see it yet She knew you and said this on purpose She thought it would hit and so it has Such a certain shot so well directed but surely my lord it was too gross too palpable too little disguised to pass on you
Rather say returned my lord too ingenuous to contain the least shadow of art Besides every thing around the place wears the air of sober elegance A handsome house—
Hired said the tutor for the purpose of gulling your lordship
I cannot conceive said Lord Hazard what makes you so warm in this business You know the world I acknowledge but give me leave to say I know it too Mr Standfast
Infinitely better said the parson with an inward sneer than I do my lord I am ready to grant but still I am a by-stander and as you appear to be playing pretty deep at this game there may be no harm in giving you a caution not to be bubbled
I know thy friendship and anxiety cried my lord but what is there to fear She is a woman of honour and if I was inclined to think of her there is no chance for me Besides I give you my word it is not my intention ever to cause Lady Hazard a moments uneasiness—but surely a beautiful woman may be admired without any offence to a wifes virtue
There my lord said Standfast is my hope your heart is my sheet anchor and upon that I trust with comfort for the safety of your honour
Enough said my lord it shall never deceive thee nor any one
Thank you my lord said Standfast I am completely satisfied I will not even fear it can deceive itself And now pray what sort of an apology do you mean to make to Mr Snaffle
A full and entire one said my lord he is entitled to it and so is the lady You and I will go together to-morrow morning and I dare say we shall very easily laugh off the whole matter
This being agreed on the conversation turned on Lady Hazard Standfast said he conceived there was some apology due to her My lord did not think so He saw in her conduct all the mysterious inquisitiveness of growing jealousy It was the first time to be sure he had ever been disingenuous with her but circumstances required it He now began to perceive there might be occurrences which would admit of treating her with a sort of laudable duplicity which indeed she ought to be thankful for—but such was the restless and unsatisfied curiosity of wives that he plainly saw she would infallibly construe it into coldness and neglect However he had seen many instances of resigned acquiescence in her duty and therefore he doubted not but this business—the truth of which he was determined to keep a secret—though it might ruffle a little yet it would not destroy their mutual tranquillity
He thought it nevertheless incumbent on him to give the matter some hue of probability the better to appease her at once To do this he told her as if casually at dinner that an affair of honour had called him out in the morning but that fortunately every thing had terminated without bloodshed
The reflection that her husband had escaped such a danger bore down in Lady Hazards mind all other considerations and she was in a moment perfectly at ease She chid him however for preferring a foolish punctilio of honour to her peace of mind and his own personal safety saying that his courage was too well established to need any such savage and unnecessary proof of it and she wondered a brutal custom should so prevail which far from exhibiting any trait of true honour or real spirit was generally the refuge of sharping knaves and the last resort of desperate cowards
Standfast acquiesced in the justice of the remark and Lord Hazard told her with a smile that had he known she possessed so much spirit he would have engaged her as his second
A silent minute or rather a silent quarter of an hour here ensued which would perhaps have lasted much longer had not the arrival of some company put an end to their different cogitations the subject of which if the reader will but think a little by way of making one it is not impossible but he may be able to guess
As the conversation now took a mixed turn and the general topics of ministers puppet-shews sermons plays sceptres wash-balls lottery tickets loaded dice lords monkies speakers parrots duchesses and drabs were alternately handled with such velocity and vociferation that the parties themselves were all talkers and no hearers
I shall therefore content myself with barely mentioning that while my lord was out of the room Mr Standfast asked Lady Hazard when he should have the honour of communicating the result of what sent him to the Smyrna
The lady agreed to hear it the next morning at which Standfast said that then and every other moment of his life was perfectly at the devotion of her ladyship even though it should be attended with far greater perils than those he had that day encountered—so saying he heaved a profound sigh and joined the company
What shall I say to the reader in this place for so far from relieving him from that suspense into which I have so completely thrown him it is certainly my intention to heighten it—but however there is a remedy for such as are over impatient for if the tenter-hooks on which I have set them prick too hard they have nothing to do but dip a few pages forward and they will find them as easy as a cushion
CHAPTER IV
WHERE THE READER BEING A LITTLE RELIEVED FROM ONE EMBARRASSMENT WILL BE THROWN INTO ANOTHER
No sooner had the complicated din of itinerant retailers opened the eyes or rather the ears of the servants—for they were yet only half awake—in that square where Lord Hazard resided than that nobleman left the partner of his bed to seek after Standfast who was suddenly awoke by a servant from a nap into which he had fallen about half an hour before for the pious preceptor had been exercising that portion of his religious duty called watching the greater part of the night
In fact the subject which occupied his thoughts was of so complicate and nice a kind that he had been turning it in his mind with much care and attention and after looking at it in every possible situation—rejecting this expedient adopting that and at last fairly satisfying himself as to the measures to be taken—he had fallen asleep just at the very instant when Phoebus awoke and walked abroad to cheer the world inspire poets and engender animalculae three employments according to some philosophers equally material
Mr Standfast understanding that his patron required his presence now only muttered those curses which he before had been thundering against the footman In a few minutes he joined Lord Hazard whom he found full of impatience and anxiety
My lord said he wanted to have five minutes conversation with him previous to their intended business that morning adding that he must candidly confess he wished for a pretext for continuing his visits at Mr Snaffles and that he could think of nothing but the sister
My lord said Standfast I am sorry to see this It can end but one way Good God that this Syren should get such hold of you in a moment—Why the most inexperienced of your adventures at Little Hockley was prudence to this
He had scarcely spoken when Lady Hazard came abruptly into the room Addressing herself to her husband she said
My lord I know not how you will receive the over anxious solicitude of a wife whose uniform study has been to administer to your wishes but I am impelled by an irresistable something to entreat that the horrid coolness you have shewn me ever since that strange business at the playhouse may be fully explained may be done away that so the tranquillity which reigned in this family till that unhappy moment and pointed us out as fit and worthy objects for imitation may be restored to us
I know not what you mean said my lord—You are a charming woman I doat on you—therefore make yourself easy and trust to the truth of my affection
Heaven forbid I should doubt it said the lady but be assured the best affections are too often endangered by the slightest misunderstandings I believe we have all three a great deal to confess to each other and I came to encourage you both by frankly acknowledging all I know and all I conjecture relative to the most extraordinary and most unpleasant business I ever yet experienced at the same time my lord let me say I have no idle curiosity to indulge no whim to gratify no foolish feminine fears that alarm me not even the slightest want of confidence in your lordships lavish love or firm fidelity—I honestly and sacredly believe that nothing could shake either—but as an artful train of flattering concurrent circumstances might give them strong as they are some slight inclination to pause I think it my duty to endeavour what I can to sustain them to hold them securely where they ought and where I am sure they wish invariably to fix
My lord paid his lady a very elegant and I believe a very sincere compliment on her intentions attachment affection sense of duty and right conception of that exquisite charm in a wifes conduct who is never officiously solicitous but ever on the watch to please He remarked however that the breakfast would interrupt nothing
Here Standfast interfering said that at breakfast Charles would necessarily make one of the party which he apprehended was not Lady Hazards wish he therefore proposed to defer it till the evening or some other time which the lady peremptorily declared she could not consent to Indeed she pressed so hard for a hearing that very morning that Standfast at the instance of my Lord Hazard undertook to set his pupil a task in the library immediately after breakfast when it was agreed that the conversation should be resumed
Perhaps Mr Standfast was glad of a moments pause He certainly betrayed evident symptoms of astonishment at the first part of Lady Hazards harrangue which added to an affected indifference and a forced sprightliness would have conveyed to an uninterrupted by-stander a trait or two of suspicion that the ladys conduct was not altogether agreeable to him but we have already hinted that he never suffered long under perturbation of any kind Thus whatever inward sensations might produce the above effects they certainly did not remain visible long enough to be noticed either by the lord or the lady and with the assistance of summoning his pupil to breakfast he had so rallied his spirits that he appeared the most cheerful and unconcerned of the whole company
It was far otherwise with my lord He set it down for a certainty that his lady had by some means discovered all that had past and divined all that was likely to come Nevertheless he felt no reluctance to review his intentions either in one light or the other but certain nameless sensations which he felt in spight of himself gave his behaviour an awkwardness which was apparent in proportion as he endeavoured to hide it
Charles was no sooner informed by his father that he had some particular business with Mr Standfast and given his task than he retired to the library when the lady after an apology much in the style of the former one acquainted her husband with all she knew relative to this strange affair not even omitting either the insult she had received the morning before the spirited kindness of Standfast or the message she had sent after him to the Smyrna which last business clearly accounted for her consusion in the library when John came back whom she also loaded with praises in which Standfast joined declaring at the same time that the hiring of that worthy fellow was a new instance that Lord Hazards knowledge of the world and judgment of mankind was superior to his for that John had what he thought a forbidding countenance which his lordship however with a penetration far beyond his had construed into a sign of bluntness and plain dealing
But madam said Standfast I interrupt you
The lady went on saying that her husbands new and extraordinary conduct had first given her the alarm In addition to this a servant had been privy to the treatment she had received from the baronet at the theatre Again he who ought to have protected her was out of the way when Mr Standfast stept forward in her defence In short such concealments and such obligations were very repugnant to her delicacy which she hoped his lordship in this case would conceive was not affected or overstrained My lord she added was the proper person to reward the servant and thank Mr Standfast who though a gentleman in years and perfectly exemplary in his manners was by no means a proper confident for her who thought it her first happiness to have no wish or thought concealed from her husband
Lord Hazard passed some very high compliments on the frankness kindness and great propriety of his ladys declaration and conduct He owned he thought the business of the baronet perfectly inexplicable but these and all other considerations were swallowed up in the obligations he thought himself under to Standfast who took all these compliments with the same composure as he would have received his salary or any thing else which he conceived to be perfectly his own property
His lordship desired this worthy friend as he called him to relate the issue of his meeting the baronet at the Smyrna but Standfast remarked that the harvest of domestic tranquillity this discovery promised belonged entirely to his lordship and the amiable Lady Hazard that at best he was but a privileged gleaner who saw but envied not that abundant happiness which kindly let fall as much comfort as he desired and more infinitely more than he deserved—he therefore begged to come in his place
Besides added he totally ignorant as your lordship is of the motives of these people for stirring up all this mischief your story cannot but involve some awkwardness which my after explanation may relieve for I fancy the baronet has made me more
au fait
to this business than either of you
His lordship taking this as a friendly hint of the tutor to clear up any embarrassment that might arise in his narrative consented to unfold It is but truth to say that his relation was not so ingenuous as that of his lady had been for he did not mention the cause of the quarrel nor that it yet existed but on the contrary said that the whole was a mistake the brother having taken him for another person who had it seems offered an insult to the sister and that every thing was amicably made up He sunk entirely the circumstance of his having seen Miss Snaffle the day before he also forbore to touch on his intention of paying that lady a second visit and indeed on any one point that could give the smallest reason for conjecture that the whole was any other than a matter of a common cursory kind which in proportion as it was mysterious so it sunk to nothing the mystery being cleared away He was very much alive however to all those matters relative to Sir Daniel Dogbolt—He hoped his friend would be able to clear them up for after all he should not consider that part of the business at an end without a full and explicit satisfaction for the insult his wife had sustained in his absence
I am heartily sorry you were absent said Standfast Proud as I was of chastising his insolence it was certainly your right
Lord Hazard acknowledged his obligations and proceeded to finish his account of this business in which upon the whole he so well succeeded that Lady Hazard declared she was except a little remaining curiosity perfectly satisfied
Now came the tutors turn He began with saying he had a much longer tale to tell than either of them and that since he was not then bound by the painful duty which had hitherto punctiliously kept him from divulging it he thought himself obliged openly and without reserve to declare all he knew on the subject
But added he I believe my lord they are too artful a set for us to place any reliance on what they tell us What I am going now to inform you I forced from the pretty baronet—if he be one—who had the unparalleled insolence to insult this lady for which—and I hope your lordship will not blame my too forward zeal I had the honour of calling him to account
Standfast here received the compliments he had once more fished for and then went on not without first exclaiming
Heavens why my lord a perfect stranger would have been entitled to the assistance I gave much less her ladyship A meer common exercise of humanity Besides the gentleman gave me very little trouble He fences pretty well but I soon disarmed him and having his life in my power I made use of this opportunity of extorting from him an account of himself and his associates He said he had long secretly admired Lady Hazard that he had tried many experiments to get an opportunity of disclosing his passion but found none which had the smallest appearance of feasibility till about three weeks ago at the masquerade where you may remember we were in a very large party
Good God cried Lady Hazard I recollect it A man certainly did teaze me at the masquerade but I took it for some drunken fool and never gave the matter a second thought
He told me said Standfast he first accosted your lordship drew you away from your company and introduced you to another that he might have better opportunity to entertain her ladyship His words were that he had found an impregnable fortress and therefore from that moment determined to give up the attack but accident introducing him into the same box at the playhouse his wishes revived and resolving to make use of the occasion that presented itself through Mr Snaffles quarrel with the gentleman in the opposite box he dropt him in the crowd and returned to Lady Hazard just as your lordship had gone to conduct Miss Snaffle to her coach He confessed that to ingratiate himself he had told her ladyship several falsities such as that you my lord had an intimacy with Miss Snaffle that you were then gone home with her all which we have already heard In short first making him answer many other questions I gave him his life and suffered him to leave me after he had protested in the most solemn manner that he would never dare to mention the name of this lady in future upon any account whatever
Well my lord these are the facts now hear my comments on them This man is not a baronet neither is he upon the point of marrying this young lady nor are they any other than three sharpers who have in some way or other a dark plot on the conjugal peace of your worthy lady and yourself This Sir Daniel did draw you aside from your company and introduced you to this very Miss Snaffle with what design is another matter but it is very extraordinary you should be left by this baronet with his intended wife that he might the better introduce himself to Lady Hazard—Nor am I mistaken as to the lady for I heard a chair called in her name
You cannot forget my lord that we at that time decided that she was a woman of no character I remember your saying with great earnestness Standfast let us not pay Lady Hazard so ill a compliment as to speak to a creature of this stamp—though she is under the same roof with her
Well my lord can it be after what I have said that this is a woman of honour that her brother is a man of the nicest feelings and that Sir Daniel Dogbolt is on the point of marriage with this woman No my lord it is as I said a plot against you however thank heaven armed with a proper confidence in each other you may despise it
Mr Standfast has placed this matter in its true light said the lady For my part I am perfectly at ease and I am sure my lord will thank me for waving all absurd delicacy and coming to this declaration
Here several suitable remarks were made Mr Standfast was loaded with thanks and the most perfect harmony was restored After this the lady retired to her dressing room and left the two friends together
They were no sooner alone than Lord Hazard began anew to compliment and thank Mr Standfast That gentleman assured his patron his thanks were more than he deserved and indeed he spoke truth However no one upon earth could have bel eved his conduct to be any other than cordial zeal and sincere friendship conformable to which appearances he said he would not leave his lordship till he had made him a firm promise not to see that woman any more who he must now very plainly perceive was a suborned wretch to assist in some vile plot against his domestic peace
My lord did not hesitate to make this promise for he was charmed with the angel-like conduct of his lady and went so far as to say that seeing the matter now in the same light with the tutor he felt himself at ease with relation to Sir Daniel Dogbolt as well as the rest Standfast hearing this and being told that his kindness should not go unremembered went with the greatest air of satisfaction to seek his pupil
As the single articles in my account with the reader begin again to be pretty numerous I shall now for his satisfaction add them up and carry them over To speak without metaphor Mr Standfast please to unmask
The preceptor then had in conjunction with Viney concerted this whole scheme The masquerade the playhouse the interview and every other part of it was as regularly digested as the trial of a felon before he comes to the bar at the Old Bailey Mr Viney had tutored the gentleman and Mrs OShocknesy had instructed the lady
Standfast however who had contrived the whole plot was totally unknown to any of the actors in it His argument with Viney and Mrs OShocknesy was that as they enjoyed the utmost they ever could expect from Lord Hazard they had no measures to keep with him especially as ever so violent a rupture could not deprive either him of his living or her of her annuity On the contrary that he Standfast might in a moment lose both his salary and his expectations which were not trifles He therefore stipulated not to be seen at all but in their privy council and instructions were particularly given to the under villains to be more cautious in deceiving him than any other of the family
This master stroke could be worthy of no other than Standfast To teach his tools to look upon him as their enemy secured him from all possibility of detection for he knew he might laugh at the resentment of Viney even if he had any cause to suspect him of treachery his own
ipfe dixit
being always sufficient to overturn any thing of that kind with his patron Nay notwithstanding this information the reader is almost obliged to confess that he is innocent for his conduct gives the lie direct even to what I have advanced of him It is very true that we have seen him act the part of a disinterested friend we have heard him counsel Lord Hazard to shun that very plot he himself had laid for him and one would think he had so far succeeded against himself—if I may be allowed the expression—that these swindlers in love seem to be turned out of employ the gentlemen to hunt other game at the hazard table or perhaps on the highway and the lady to ruin apprentices or gull libidinous elders
If the reader thinks thus of Mr Standfast he is not yet half acquainted with that consummate fabricator of domestic ruin A simple intrigue and the common incidental train of disquietude attending it would not have been a luxury inexorable enough for him In short Mr Standfast put on your mask again for we will not see your naked heart till we are prepared to pronounce by a knowledge of the species of destruction it meditates—that in the round of human conception there is not so shocking a piece of deformity as a complete hypocrite
CHAPTER VI
SEVERAL LETTERS MORE PLOT AND INTRIGUE AND SOME OF IT FROM A VERY UNEXPECTED QUARTER
THE day on which this eclaircissement took place was distinguished by the cheerfulness that sat on every countenance Indeed so remarkable was the prevalent good humour that Mr Standfast was heartily joined by a great deal of company who dined at my lords when he ventured an opinion that Hazard house had the only roof in town that could boast of a couple perfectly elegant and perfectly happy I do not pretend to assert that this declaration was truth I only say the company then present allowed it to be so
My lord would not read a single letter—for many were that day brought him—lest it should give a tinge of dissatisfaction that might check the general hilarity They were all ordered to be laid in the study and it was agreed that he and Standfast should look them over the next morning
The whole day being like a smooth sea which looked the more beautiful for having been a little ruffled we will glide over it as too uniform for any striking remarks and come to the next which was a little more agitated
As soon as breakfast was over his lordship and Standfast according to agreement retired to examine the letters These were seven in number and as four of them in some degree relate to this history I shall insert them together with the remarks of their examiners Indeed it was once in my head to have given this whole history through that vehicle but I considered that making my personages retire to their closets before they disclosed their sentiments would have thrown a frigidity over the business besides the unavoidable necessity of relating every thing two or three times over and always partially Besides I may introduce some characters who cannot write and others who will not Mr Standfast for instance would not have been possessed of half the cunning I have given him if any thing could have induced him to disclose his sentiments upon paper
Upon reflection therefore I was determined not to follow a method however fashionable by which I must have made villains confide their vices and young ladies their wishes—which if they felt delicately they would find difficult to express at all much less in a letter—to their confidants and clerks of the roads
All such matters considered I have left these penny-post men in biography to themselves contented to jog on an old road where what the prospects want of trimming and regulation will I trust be made up in simple and natural luxuriance But to the letters under examination
LETTER I
TO THE RIGHT HON LORD HAZARD
MY LORD
The letter I now send you is accompanied by one from your son who is determined to chuse a guardian—being eighteen years of age—unless you intend to do him more justice
You have withdrawn your protection from him in favour of your darling Charles whom the virtuous Mr Standfast is training in the paths of honour
I shall forbear to reflect on either him you your lady or her offspring it is enough that I know you all I only ask at present—which will determine to whom my son shall look in future as a protector—that you will make over to me that part of the estate in Warwickshire which includes the mansion and the farm contiguous to it in which case neither Zekiel nor I shall be further troublesome to you but contentedly make his two hundred a year and my three serve us till that happy moment when it shall please fate to unite your lordly bones to the skins of your ancestors
I am &c GERTRUDE OSHOCKNESY
Standfast having thanked the lady for her glance at him and my lord having laughed heartily at the good natured reflection on his extraction in the latter part of the letter they passed on to the next which contained what follows
LETTER II
TO THE RIGHT HON LORD HAZARD
MY LORD AND FATHER
For so I believe you are at least you could not prove to the contrary and thats enough for me to know I shall inherit in spight of my brother Charles But however as I dont want to be undutiful I shall only tell you this I am sick of Eton Id rather follow a pack of hounds and so dye see I have desired mother to make you a proposial concerning Warwickshire If so be you like to agree to it its very well if not I am determined to look out for a guardian being now as a body may say pretty far gone towards years of discretion So I remain
Your dutiful son And servant to command RUST
What could a guardian do said my lord—
Faith be very troublesome replied Standfast These estates in tail without right of waste are of all legal niceties the best morsel for a litigious stomach As to what the lady and her son want your lordship knows best whether it is worth contending for but I think I would not be bullied out of any thing
Well we will consider what is to be done said his lordship in the mean time let us to the next
So saying he opened another letter which came by the post and was written by Sir Sidney Roebuck These were the contents
LETTER III
TO THE RIGHT HON LORD HAZARD
MY LORD
I take the liberty to write to you concerning your village of Little Hockley which since the absence of your lordship and the death of Major Malplaquet has risen to such maturity in singular and enormous vice as I sincerely hope cannot be paralleled
I have been obliged to be at the pains of exerting myself very strenuously in my capacity of magistrate but smugglers marauders and other lawless characters for whom this vile place is become a remarkable asylum are difficult to deal with My first idea was in conjunction with the members for the county to beg the interference of parliament but conceiving that much delicacy was due to your lordship in this business I beg previously to consult you
If you will treat for the village or should that be incompatible with the conditions of your inheritance if you will lease it to me perhaps I may be able to bring about a reformation
I have no doubt but your lordship will rejoice in forwarding a work so dear to the interest of humanity and should be happy to receive your immediate answer as I wish to make some arrangements at Castlewick agreeable to the result of this application before I attend my duty at the house when I shall have the honour to call on your lordship with a view to a further conference on this subject
I am My Lord Your Lordships Most obedient Servant S W ROEBUCK
Lord Hazard as I formerly mentioned received his rents regularly from his steward and therefore did not dream of the enormities carried on at Little Hockley He now first reflected that these seeds of vice he had himself sown and as wickedness like weeds flourishes best where there are no wholesome plants to interrupt its growth he easily perceived and felt the truth of Sir Sidneys relation and therefore determined to acquaint him that he was as well disposed as himself to perfect so desirable an undertaking and that he should be glad to see him for that purpose
After examining another letter or two they came to the following one
LETTER IV
TO THE RIGHT HON LORD HAZARD
MY LORD
As you have thought proper to take no notice of what passed the other evening when I had the honour of calling your lordship scoundrel I suppose you acquiesce in the justice of the term—I shall therefore in future speak of you as of a wretch deserving pity and though a lord beneath the notice of a gentleman
I am &c PETER SNAFFLE
Oh said my lord this is too shocking to pass I must break the fellows bones
Rather get a chairman to do it said Standfast Did not you wait at the rascals house two hours Where was he all that time No no they think you begin to smell the matter out and so are grown desperate Does not all this confirm my suspicions
But still said my lord there is something cursedly unpleasant in letting such a scoundrel go on with impunity I am determined continued he to give him manuel chastisement whereever I meet him
Not at all cried Standfast till he has established his credentials to dispute a point of honour with your lordship
Well well perhaps you are right said my lord you generally see things very properly Let us talk no more of the damned fellow he has set my blood in a ferment
The conversation was interrupted by a note from Ingot in the city with whom—as the reader formerly heard from Mr Standfast—Lord Hazard sometimes banked The letter was concerning the transfer of some stock and other business on which he required to see his lordship at an early opportunity and my lord as he was anxious to advise with counsel what was best to be done with Mrs OShocknesy and her son thought he could not take a properer time than the present
As his lordship went alone into the city he had leisure to revolve in his mind the various business of the day and in particular the subject of the letter from Snaffle which he did not enter into much before Mr Standfast knowing that an inclination to indulge his feelings would meet with every possible opposition from that careful friend
At the same time however that he gave Standfast credit for the goodness of his intentions he could not help thinking the conjectures of that gentleman rather prescient than wise careful than certain What was all this mighty business Why truly a hot-headed fellow had insulted him with great acrimony and written to him with great impertinence What were Standfasts ideas of this matter That a plot was laid to disturb his domestic repose In truth it appeared so by the assault on his lady and looked something like it by the tempting opportunity that had been given him of addressing a very beautiful woman Well it was so perhaps in that case the proper check had been given to the first and as to the latter he could see no ruinous consequences that would ensue even were they to carry their scheme into execution He could not be drawn into a marriage and therefore an intrigue was the worst that could be apprehended This it was his business to avoid and he certainly should do so but was this any reason why he must put up with a most provoking and impudent affront No no he must beg leave to understand the etiquette of his own honour as well as Mr Standfast He was no school boy and therefore took the liberty to dissent from the necessity of having his actions eternally inspected and as to the affront which he neither could nor would brook a proper time should certainly be taken to resent it
Lord Hazard had now arrived to that very pitch where Standfast wished to conduct him The tutor knew that no longer to confide in him was the only way to keep him safe from all consequences He waited with malicious joy for the moment when the patron would voluntarily exclaim Oh that I had taken thy advice Oh that thy salutary counsel had been followed—and I say to the reader woe be to Lord Hazard if ever the moment should arrive when such an exclamation shall be necessary But at present let us change the scene
In the course of his lordships business with Mr Ingot a lady passed through the room whom he remarked spoke nothing but French for there were two gentlemen with her one of whom told Mr Ingot in very broken English that the lady wished him a good morning
After they were gone Ingot told my lord that there was something singular in the ladys story which had been so interwoven with a business concerning money he had been recommended to transact for her that he could not but be perfectly acquainted with it
My lord who had never any improper curiosity seemed very indifferent about hearing it saying there were family matters in it not proper to be divulged
Ingot assured my lord that was not the case at all on the contrary he should tell it to every one he knew because it placed in a more glaring point of view the scandalous traffic and shameful selling and buying of consciences among the papists a sect it seems for which Mr Ingot had a great inveteracy than any instance that had ever come within his knowledge
My Lord smiled and Mr Ingot continued—
This lady when she was very young having unfortunately an intrigue with a stranger her father had a great aversion to she was secluded in a convent but what convent her lover never could learn After some time being persuaded by her friends that her enamorato had played her false she was prevailed on to take the veil and shut herself up as every one thought for ever
About a year and a half ago her father died in England having long repented of his daughters ill treatment and made a will leaving her his whole fortune all vested in the English funds Mind the conditions to be spent in France half for her own use and half in pious donations—provided a dispensation of her vow could be obtained but in default of this to go to English charities
Here was manifest the cunning of the Frenchman He thought and rightly too the pious donations in France would procure interest enough to obtain the dispensation of her vow Ay ay the Pope shall make a bargain with any Jew in Dukes-place
The dispensation was obtained with this single proviso—which indeed grasped at the whole fortune—that she should live pensioner in the same convent with liberty to go out when she pleased
These terms the lady accepted and giving security for her return she was permitted to come to England in company with a person deputed by the convent to arrange her fathers affairs This she has now done and in a week or ten days will return to France
An extraordinary business indeed said Lord Hazard
Yes yes replied Ingot with great archness the church of Rome never fails to stretch its prerogative when interest is in the case How happy are we who live under the three estates and the protestant religion
Spoken as a citizen should speak said my lord Poor lady I dare say she rejoices at her escape from captivity What does she think of England
Oh she knows nobody here cried Ingot Except one gentleman she has not enquired for a single creature How she came to know him is a mystery to me It is Sir Sidney Roebuck I have promised to find him out for her if he be in town
Then I can tell you Mr Ingot that he is not answered my lord I received a letter from him this very morning which induces me to think it will be a fortnight first as he only talks of coming up by the meeting of parliament
Well well she will not see him then cried Ingot—it is no great matter I suppose
Here the conversation drew to an end the lord testifying great pleasure at the ladys emancipation from confinement and the citizen reprobating the folly of immuring healthy young girls who ought to increase their species and produce soldiers and sailors and thanking his stars that he did not live under the influence of an Italian priest not half so good a citizen as himself a fellow who because he wore a triple crown could roast and barbecue any of his peaceable subjects whenever he pleased the better to confiscate their fortunes
CHAPTER VII
THE LAST SUBJECT FOLLOWED UP—A LETTER FROM EMMA AND OTHER IMPORTANT MATTER
THAT very afternoon Lord Hazard wrote an answer to Sir Sidneys letter the receipt of which gave the baronet such satisfaction that it hastened his journey to town where in a few days he arrived for his concerns were always in so regular a state that he could at any time leave them with very short preparation and Lady Roebuck who was of all women living the properest wife for such a man never required much warning to follow him through all his duties for such he conceived every one of his pursuits It was a duty to discharge all trusts to answer all letters to return all visits but then he took care to undertake nothing but what he could conveniently do to receive no visits but from those he liked and to reject all unnecessary or impertinent correspondents It was also with him a duty to be merry and to make others so and he could with equal ease—ay and without any deviation from his illustrious extraction which I have already said he was pretty proud of—walk a minuet with a duchess on a birth-night or crack a facetious jest with a cobler He might be termed an elegant oddity and to his peculiarities for they were all amiable did his lady accommodate herself
Before they set out it was agreed to leave the faithful Emma with little Annette who had nearly reached her fourteenth year and was grown a most beautiful young creature Lady Roebuck loved her with an interesting and lively tenderness She had watched her growing perfections with at least maternal care for had she been twenty times her own daughter she could not have paid more attention to her education or felt more pleasure at those dawning accomplishments with which she promised to be remarkably gifted
Emma said she had perused her little mind with profound attention and though she was no further than the introduction it was prefaced with a promise of such delightful matter as could not fail to charm the hearts of all readers She could discern that the subject was interesting the moral instructive and that goodness and virtue were strongly inculcated in every page
Annette and Emma then and the whole village of Castlewick were left under the care of the good Mildman who had not suffered at all in the opinion of Sir Sidney for having been turned into a scarecrow for the amusement of the Hockleyites
Sir Sidney and his lady arrived in town at the period above mentioned and a card was almost instantly dispatched to Lord Hazard purporting that the baronet intended to pay him a visit in a day or two to talk over the business of Little Hockley
The peer and the baronet soon came to an eligible agreement and as leases and title deeds were obliged to be consulted in great plenty during the course of this negociation a sort of cordiality grew between the lessor and lessee Sir Sidney acknowledged there was great fairness and candour in the conduct of the peer and facetiously remarked he was glad to see so good an understanding between the upper and lower house As to my lord he looked up to Sir Sidney as a being of a superior kind and while he penetrated his amiable and benignant views his only wonder was that every man of ample possessions did not do the same since his reward was so certain and so immense
The ladies who I have more than once remarked were to their husbands what an echo is to the voice had also commenced something more than an acquaintance which both the husbands strongly recommended Indeed this intimacy had well nigh brought about a breach of the bargain between Lord Hazard and Sir Sidney for the latter had proposed to the peer to wave signing the writings and take upon himself the arrangements of Little Hockley However whether my lord felt the superiority of Sir Sidneys qualifications for such an undertaking whether he thought it ridiculous to expect a harvest of virtue where he had only planted vice whatever in short was the motive he agreed only to return to Warwickshire with Sir Sidney and give him possession of his bargain by which means the families would pass some months in the society of each other
Even this was some acquisition and Sir Sidney in hopes of enticing his lordship to follow his example eagerly catched at the proposal Schemes of pleasure to be executed in the following spring and summer engrossed much of their conversation Besides Lady Hazard was with child and it was thought the country would be likely to restore her strength after she should have lain in for she was in general very ill upon those occasions and had never since Charles had a child—though she had borne in all four—that did not after its birth pine away and at length die
Pleasures were also chalked out for Charles and Annette who was understood to be Sir Sidneys daughter by a former marriage but that her mother died abroad and the baronet did not spare to hint that an union between the prince and princess of the two rival villages might perhaps cement the general amnesty between all parties
It will be easily seen that Standfast felt awkward in this society He too well knew Lady Roebucks prudence to suppose that she had acquainted Sir Sidney with any of his tricks and as there seemed no coolness on the part of the baronet these conjectures were confirmed Thus supposing the business would be concluded in a short time between his patron and Sir Sidney he was so far perfectly at ease but when he found the ladies were to be consulted he trembled for the consequence How to act Suppose he tried to prevent their meeting but that was dangerous and difficult He once thought of hinting at a distance that something had actually passed between him and the lady which if credited would account for any rancour in her but upon maturer reflection any of these would be to desert his own grand principle which was to be always prepared with expedients but never to use them except in cases of emergency It would be enough to defend himself when he should be attacked and all things considered since the lady had evidently kept the grand point a secret from Sir Sidney it was possible though barely so that she would not tattle to any one else yet that cursed female vanity—In short the gentlemans combat with himself continued a considerable while till at length the result was that he should make an excuse to go out of town for a month and by that means gather from Lord Hazards letters what was going forward Besides he had another reason for taking this resolution—indeed he had several reasons—which will in due time appear to the reader—so having imparted his intention to my lord and got permission for Charles to accompany him the tutor and the pupil set out for the west of England where business of a particular nature demanded their presence
Thus most of the arrangements before related passed in the absence of Standfast and Charles whom as their excursion has something remarkable in it we will join after I have related a matter that cursorily passed between the two ladies
They were talking of Annette and Lady Sidney who was by no means ashamed of confessing so much of the truth as saved the honour of Miss Le Clerc mentioned the matter exactly as it happened simply with the addition of their being privately married
But said Lady Hazard are you sure that the mother is dead
Sure said Lady Roebuck what doubt can there be of that Besides at any rate she is dead to the world
Perhaps not said the other lady Good God have you any reason for what you say
cried Lady Roebuck Lady Hazard here made a very serious apology for her imprudence saying the great similarity between the story she had heard from her ladyship and one recently told her by my lord had struck her so forcibly that she had unwarily betrayed herself into those unguarded expressions
This redoubled Lady Roebucks anxiety and she entreated in the most earnest manner to know what all this mystery meant
Nay said Lady Hazard if it be as I conjecture it must be known for the lady is determined to see Sir Sidney before she leaves England
Who—what lady—cried her friend for heavens sake keep me no longer in suspence
Lady Hazard seeing she had advanced so far made no scruple of relating the whole story as Ingot told it to my lord from first to last When she had finished Lady Roebuck asked the name of the lady which her friend confessed she did not know but said that it would be very easy to satisfy themselves by sending to Mr Ingot
This was scarcely agreed on before Lady Roebuck received a letter from her handmaid Emma which the reader shall have in her own words
TO LADY ROEBUCK
MADAM
YOU would not have heard from me so soon again but for a circumstance which wears so much the air of a romance that had it not been well certified I could not have believed it—but
Dark and mysterious are the ways of providence
Puzzled with mazes and perplexed with errors
As says my and Mr VOLTAIREs favourite Cato—A lady called here who cried over Miss Annette and has left a crucifix and several popish relics which I cannot say pleased me for I have hated the Roman catholics ever since I read the account of the massacre of the Hugunots upon the feast of St Bartholomew As to the holy war some of the kings of England were concerned in that and therefore I shall not be so wanting in loyalty as to mention it else I could a tale unfold—But to return to the lady There were two French gentlemen with her one of whom in very bad broken English told me that he believed she had an important commission to execute but he did not know the purport of it I wish I had understood French I would have made her all her pilgrimage relate as faithfully as Othello did his After she was gone which was not till the gentleman had kissed both my cheeks I questioned Miss concerning their conversation and she informed me that the lady was that very same she used to call Mamma Le Clerc in the convent The jewels she has left are for Sir Sidney and as she had not the pleasure of seeing him she did not think proper to leave a packet of papers but said she would endeavour to find him in town and there deliver it to him
Lord my dear lady what can be the meaning of all this Miss Annette was so confused and terrified and indeed she did not understand her very well for they spoke it seems a different sort of French our young lady having polished hers and that of the stranger being a good deal provincial but as I said dear Misss confusion—though very learned writers have doubted whether this admits of a genetive case and therefore as I am proud to yield to great authorities I ought to say the confusion of Miss—was so great that she had not the courage to ask many questions so I entreated her to go back and speak to the French lady again who appeared greatly surprised to find that Sir Sidney was married and when Miss Annette at my desire asked if she was her mother she replied that your ladyship was now the only mother to whom she owed any duty that she hoped you would treat her kindly and that Miss would repay you with gratitude
My sweet little charge is very well and comes on surprisingly I entreated her not to write on this subject till I had your advice Her letter could not avoid falling into Sir Sidneys hands This will seem only to concern household affairs and as the poet says
Escape the scythe by being low
I hate a falsity but without a little laudable deceit how can we guard against the evils of life—Minerva thought duplicity so necessary in the conduct of her favourite Ulysses that she condescended to teach him that heroic quality herself
I beg to know my worthy lady how I am to act in this affair and be assured in respect of all the requisite feminine virtues no Emma—from Priors nut-brown maid to Emma Corbet can have a more extensive and proper sense than
Your very humble And most grateful handmaid EMMA DISTICH
This letter seemed to clear up the whole business and it being upon enquiry found that the name of the lady his lordship saw at Mr Ingots house was Le Clerc Lady Roebuck did not ballance a moment in her mind as to the probability of her being the mother of Annette
In this exigence she consulted Lady Hazard on what conduct she ought to pursue who being as we have seen no friend to duplicity though even of that laudable kind recommended by Emma advised her without delay to inform Sir Sidney of the whole truth telling her she had wonderfully well succeeded with her lord by the same mode of experiment within the last fortnight
This brought forward the story of Miss Snaffle which the reader has seen so fully investigated and which not being told without the highest encomiums on Mr Standfasts attachment and integrity and an information that his lordship had settled an additional annuity on him Lady Roebuck testified the greatest surprise which Lady Hazard perceiving said you may well shudder at the worlds villany I wish I could prevail with my lord to embrace Sir Sidneys offer that I might live always with you in retirement
Lady Roebuck whose shudderings had been at hearing of Standfasts great influence in the family was upon the point of saying something which might have led to an investigation of his conduct not very favourable to that gentleman but finding Lady Hazard had given her surprise another motive she contented herself for the present with falling in with that ladys conjectures and simply remarking that indeed the expectations of villains were so inadequate to the pains they took and the risks they run that she wondered men became knaves to be infamous when by only being honest they might be happy
CHAPTER VIII
THE HERO CLEARED A LITTLE FROM THE COBWEBS OF THE LIBRARY
I MAKE no scruple to confess that my leaving the business of Miss Le Clerc and the possibility of Standfasts detection in such a state of uncertainty as they appeared to be at the end of the last chapter is taking a liberty with the reader and what is worse with the ladies But the consideration of having so long forborne to introduce my hero who by the way would be the last to excuse me for being guilty of the smallest incivility to the fair sex has got the better of all others—for indeed the circumstances in this history are so various and follow in such quick succession that really if I do not use some expedition to bring him forward I might as well have no hero at all Just so far however I have nothing to reproach myself with for though hitherto he has said very little I can assure the reader he has thought a great deal To what purpose will hereafter appear At present I shall proceed to the examination of his good and bad qualities a portion of each—for I am afraid there is nothing perfect in this world—he certainly had and having cleared away the shores and made every other proper preparation—for we may well give him fair play—fairly launch him on the ocean of life where we shall see him steming many adverse gales of fortune in which it will be difficult to determine whether most to admire his distress or his fortitude
I certainly had some apprehensions that having suffered a fourth part of this work to pass without approaching to such a necessary business the reader might perhaps be given to imagine that I called Charles Hazard the hero out of facetiousness and merely by inference and deduction and so use him as a painter does a layman which stands in all the attitudes bears the helmet drapery or poll parrot of the hero or heroine and yet though he play this respectable part is never known personally to the spectators
To say the truth I have often been wickedly inclined to wish that many heroes I have met with in my life had been so dealt with and it is not impossible but some of my readers may retort the courtesy for it so happens that particular people find in these said heroes particular qualities which generally being adventitious it is fifty to one if a hero-maker thinks of them and in the absence of these qualities though the gentleman should be possessed of ever so long a catalogue of real and permanent virtues he sinks to a nonentity in the opinion of such critics because he does not happen to be enlivened with their favourite animating principle
I cannot give a stronger instance of what I have advanced than by producing the names of two of the greatest men in their way that ever lived—I mean ALEXANDER of Macedon the great warrior and ALEXANDER of Twickenham the great poet
ALEXANDER the warrior would not have given three-pence for all the noisy applause and bellowing acclamations of the largest populace that ever assembled if they had not hailed him son of Jupiter and ALEXANDER the poet—according to Dr JOHNSON—continually made himself wretched lest the world should fancy him to be the son of nobody yet I appeal to any one if the fighting hero had been the offspring of a beggar and the writing hero the heir of a king whether one would have cut throats or the other
lisped numbers
in greater perfection Neither of these could conquer his favourite foible which it is admirable to remark proceeded in the warrior from hope and in the poet from fear This imaginary honour in one and blot in the other nothing could efface for vainly did ALEXANDERs mother ridicule the preposterous folly of her son saying
hush hush my dear boy you dont consider you are bringing me into a scrape for if you talk so loud about being the son of Jupiter you will make Juno angry with me
—and equally unsuccessful were the efforts of POPEs friends who it is said told him it was ridiculous to lament that he was the son of a tradesman when the father of ESCHINES the Socratic philosopher was but a sausage-maker
A hundred instances may be adduced perhaps a thousand to prove upon what cobweb qualities the very essence of a hero often depends but none I believe can be found stronger than those I have given Let us then settle the dispute in this way Let all matters relative to Charles Hazard which are totally dependant upon chance be considered as out of his power to alter or amend and all qualities good bad or indifferent which are the result of his serious reflections be understood as his act and deed and censured or praised accordingly
Charles had been left from his infancy in the quiet and unwearied pursuit of every useful and elegant accomplishment All these advantages had been procured for him at home under a tutor who certainly had some taste and a father who had more both of whom were perfectly well satisfied with his progress His ardour had been so unremitting that perfection by the help of perseverence seemed to be within his reach I therefore left him to himself for why should I interrupt him in the midst of so laudable a career—especially when those very advantages are good recommendations to the reader
Having untied him however a little from his mothers apron strings I shall now fairly trust him to the bent of his inclination—and this for several good reasons—one is that my veracity as a historian obliges me to it for Standfast declared to Viney before he set out—first indeed giving him some other instructions—he should try what mettle the youngster was made of
Charles was at this time something more than seventeen so that he took the field young as did his namesake of Sweden He was not however at all like that great man in any respect except indeed that no Charles the Twelfth upon earth could be a more rigid observer of his word for as the Swedish Charles could never be perswaded by any body the English Charles placed an implicit faith in every body and as the fighting hero hated the sight of a woman the scientific hero was charmed with every woman he saw
Charles—for there is no hiding it—was very amorous and very credulous His credulity however was not of that kind begot by adulation upon impudence he was too modest to be vain but when a plausible appeal was made to the softness of his manners the strength of his sensibility or the excellence of his heart his expanded soul cherished the fiction because it wore the garb of truth therefore in him credulity was a virtue and yet virtue would be in much less repute than it is—for which there is little necessity—if it met with no better reward His propensity to the softer passions were though so young of a pretty robust kind for he had already attacked and that very briskly fat Betty who by force of arms or rather fists defended her virtue Nor was he less solicitous with Lady Hazards woman before whom about a week previous to his journey his father found him on his knees which accident produced the following short lecture
My lord having pretty well shamed him said—
Charles I am glad to see this grace in you I never before spoke to you with the harshness of a father hitherto you have had nothing from me but the mildness of that character I am scarcely sorry for what has happened because it gives me an opportunity of speaking on a subject which I could not otherwise so well have introduced—You have heard of my excesses in my youth they have cost me reflections bitterer than I would wish my worst enemy I am not hurt at seeing you susceptible nor do I expect as you grow up to keep you entirely continent You are informed your opinions are decided ones and you have an understanding far beyond your years or I should not be so explicit You have conferred on me one great blessing which I know you will never deprive me of I mean a faithful observance of your word upon all occasions If upon consulting your heart you can truly make me the promise I am going to ask of you these are the last words you shall ever hear from me on this subject I would naturally recommend to you to think of no idle amours but perhaps that is impossible if it should be so chuse some other place than your fathers house let me know nothing of it I should pity and perhaps forgive the frailties of my son but I should shudder at being his confidant
The promise I exact from you is to combat your inclinations upon all occasions but to subdue them absolutely and entirely when they tempt you to the seduction of a wife or daughter or any way tend to disturb domestic happiness
My dear father cried Charles throwing himself on his knees and taking Lord Hazards hand I promise you your advice shall be engraven on my heart and so may I prosper as I keep or reject it
Enough said Lord Hazard abundantly enough I know you will keep your word and therefore nothing can pass between you and I upon this subject again
Foibles our hero certainly had in plenty but he had also many excellent qualities Indeed they will be well exercised in the course of this work for though no temper was ever more tried or mind more worked upon yet I defy any one to detect him in the commission of either an ungenerous or a dishonourable action
This in common heroes is nothing for being made up entirely of sterling virtues without alloy what wonder if they come out of the fire of temptation pure and undeminished—but for an elegant handsome fine young fellow unsuspecting inexperienced sensible accomplished born to captivate and be captivated—for such a one neither to turn out a puppy nor a knave is an instance that does not every day attract our admiration
But I have often held—and many will agree with me—that is is as easy to do right as wrong and in my hero this truth is illustrated for know reader this young gentleman preserved his honour nay perhaps his life by a strict adherence to one ruling principle which being so young it is singularly admirable he should set down for himself It was this never to promise what was improper to perform but having made a promise never to break it
CHAPTER IX
ABOUT BUNDLING AND OTHER AMCROUS MATTERS
STANDFASTs journey into the country was to the house of a young clergyman to whom he was patron Read it ye great and confess your insignificance Your dependants have their hangers on your very toad-eaters have their tools nay sometimes you are their tools yourselves Has not your steward his carriage his country house his hounds his partridge mews and his doxey and do not you pay for it Nay he is in point of certainty so much better off than you that were you to be ruined and even through his mismanagement he could behold the wreck from the shore and get comfortably to a retreat which your bounty provided for him
This young clergyman whose name was Figgins was originally a Bridewell boy Standfast took a great fancy to him one evening as he signalized himself on a rejoicing night The peculiar address with which he broke the windows of such as would not put out lights and threw squibs into coaches to frighten ladies and burn their cloaths evinced such a proneness to mischief that Standfast felt a congenial warmth and immediately determined to select this youth as a fit instrument in time for nobler daring
It was necessary however that he should add to this unluckiness and audacity a necessary portion of subtilty He therefore asked him several questions to which he received such answers as pleased him that is to say full of impudence and ambiguity and hearing him afterwards tell one of his companions that he had queered Raven Grey his mind was so made up that he determined—to use his own phrase—upon patronizing him
The reader however must not imagine that Mr Standfast laid himself open to his dependant the matter was apparently brought about through the medium of a third person indeed Mr Viney to whom this hopeful youth was a distant relation and he was required among other things to consider Mr Standfast as an exemplary character
The tutor prevailed upon a bishop a friend of his—I sincerely hope the bishop did not know what he was about—to ordain this spark and this was the very friend he left in the care of Little Hockley
At the time Charles and his tutor paid this visit to Mr Figgins he was in the possession of a vicarage near Poole which living Standfast procured him from a noble earl in some respects however owing to the young parsons own conduct for he was so civil to introduce to his lordship a near relation which circumstance ended in my lords making up for a large sum of money a suit which the young lady commenced against him for seduction though the earl was about her thirteenth lover One of this number by her advice quitted the kingdom lest he should be taken up for the forgery of a bank note which after he was gone she changed and put the money in her pocket
Standfasts business with Mr Figgins was of a very particular nature and perhaps the reader may sometime hence join with me in that opinion—Whatever it was Standfast did not chuse to transact it by letter it being one of his maxims never to write any thing but what all the world might read nor make either promises or declarations in the presence of a third person
In conformity to this latter part of his maxim he very frequently took his friend Figgins with him either a walk or a ride begging Charles to take care of the ladies till their return These ladies were first Mr Figginss maiden aunt a woman of exemplary character an enthusiastic admirer of Drelincourt and a dram glass and who her nephew very humanely maintained upon her paying him down quarterly the sum of eight pounds Secondly Mrs Figgins the ninth—for like Major OFlaherty he had them in all quarters and all alive and merry—and lastly Miss Figgins a young lady of beauty and accomplishments but who had not yet got a husband—though she owned twenty-seven—because the men were brutes and her nature was so delicate that the least ill treatment would break her heart
Charles found it no disagreeable task to entertain these ladies in the absence of his tutor nay he made a traffic of his complaisance for he wrote an impromtu for a smile and sketched their portrait for a kiss His skill in music enchanted them and they wished never to part with the young lord as he was called
As to Miss Figgins had any one witnessed her behaviour at those unguarded moments when he sung a pathetic air—though by the bye he was of that age when the voice sounds more like that of a raven than a nightingale—he would have sworn she had at once conquered her aversion to love and matrimony To say truth her virtue was of the rampant kind which perhaps was one reason she continually talked of the great pains she took to subdue it Indeed she so prompted Charles in that part which if it had been the time to act he knew without a cue that the young gentleman had a kind of rebellion to quell which gave him no little disturbance In short in spight of his teeth he was obliged to take a review of the promise he had made his father and reflecting that the sister of Mr Figgins must certainly be a woman of honour he triumphantly carried the point and congratulated himself on this victory over his passions Indeed the term sister was not included in the conditions but it was certainly implied and it would have been dishonourable had he taken advantage of the omission
The lady however having made good her landing determined to lose no opportunity of improving that advantage therefore one day while they sat at dinner she slily slipt a note into the young gentlemans coat pocket which contained these words both in form and substance
For hevven sake mete mee in the arburr and lett mee ho lett mee unbuzzum myself
Charles was too gallant not to attend the lady—Indeed it was very much his wish to have a little conversation with her alone not doubting but when the purity of his intentions were honestly made known the young ladys quiet would be restored which at present he made no doubt he greatly disturbed Having therefore attended the appointment he declared to her with the truest and most honest simplicity his repugnance to do that which he could not consider otherwise than as a shameful breach of hospitality The lady acknowledged the generosity of his sentiments and said that as she saw her fears were unnecessary they might now indulge in all those little innocent freedoms which to susceptible and delicate hearts gave such delight—In short after much simpering stammering blushing and other indications of maiden bashfulness—the largest part of which especially the blushing was most manifest in Charles—she informed him that upon certain conditions he should steal to her bedchamber and sleep with her that very night These conditions were explained to be exactly what I am informed they practise very commonly and very innocently in America under the name of bundling
Perhaps Miss Figgins had heard of Adhelm who to try his virtue slept several nights with a virgin without violating his chastity and understanding Charles was intended for a great man determined it should not be her fault if he had not this proof of his virtue in as great perfection as his pious predecessor If however these were her intentions there was some how or other an infraction in the treaty for Charles and the lady so bundled that at the end of a fortnight she informed him in the most decent manner so delicate a creature could muster up words for the purpose that she was certainly with child
What a stroke for our hero Must he begin already to feel the bitter reflections of having broken his promise How to act Which way to conceal her shame He could not marry her—which at some intervals he had thoughts of—without consulting his father and the consequence of such a consultation was apparent Yet he had ruined her and brought her into a situation that marriage alone could atone for In so doing he had already broken his promise and why not go farther since there was no honourable means of retreat
In this state chequered with pleasure and compunction had he passed several days when Mr Standfast one morning told our hero that some damned thing or other had come to his fatheris ears who required their immediate presence in town—
See there
said he shewing him a letter he had that instant received
TO THE REV Mr STANDFAST
If you have the smallest regard for my peace of mind come post to me the moment you receive this
HAZARD
Charles not doubting but his amour and its consequences had already reached his fathers ears without considering how the intelligence could have been conveyed told his tutor ingenuously that he was the cause of it Mr Standfast seemed greatly astonished at the declaration and demanded how it could possibly be The pupil exacting a solemn promise from his tutor that he would carefully preserve the most profound secresy let him into the bundling secret from first to last and concluded with vehemently entreating his advice
Standfast looking very sagacious said this must be the cause of Lord Hazards injunction sure enough which it was a very proper thing to comply with for fear of irritating him farther As for the rest he said it was a cursed unlucky affair but fortunately the brother was under his thumb and his best endeavours might be depended on to hush matters up
If his father should mention it he advised Charles to deny the whole business though he had no doubt but he should use such arguments as would induce him not to say a word about it
Charles was in raptures at the kindness of his tutor who took care nevertheless to give the young gentleman a wholesome lecture declaring his great repugnance to this duplicity of conduct and protesting he only consented to it from the laudable view of preventing a difference between father and son
By this time the chaise was at the door for Standfast zealous to obey his patrons mandate had ordered it previous to this conversation with his pupil The latter therefore took a hasty but tender leave of his enamorata who exacted a promise that he would write to her and if possible see her soon again
On the road Standfast encouraged Charles to keep up his spirits He told him for one thing that his honour was in no scrape for that the lady however she might have imposed upon his inexperience was not a vestal nor had been for a good twenty years
Why she is but six and twenty said Charles
and eleven added to it replied the tutor As to the brat if there should be one we must see whats to be done with it I have told you all these matters added he lest you should be improperly drawn in therefore you must promise me to be upon your guard No indiscreet marriages nor any other steps without first consulting me Upon these and no other terms will I undertake this business
Charles eagerly promised every thing his tutor demanded of him and Standfast reiterated his friendly professions They both arrived in town however with no little anxiety on their minds That of Charles proceeded as the reader knows from his fear of having made his father miserable Mr Standfast had too hearty a contempt for every human weakness to feel the influence of any such hen-hearted sensation Glorious mischief begat his perplexity and all his uneasiness was lest the banquet preparing for his inexorable senses should not be seasoned high enough with domestic wretchedness
CHAPTER X
CONSISTING OF COMFORT AND CONSOLATION ADMINISTERED BY THE FRIENDLY MR STANDFAST
IT was agreed upon the arrival of Charles and his tutor that the latter should go first to see how the land lay and that the young gentleman should not see his father—thereby to give their project breath—till he had paid his respects to Lady Hazard
Mr Standfast immediately sought my lord and having very opportunely found him he was informed with but little previous ceremony that his patron was undone—lost—irretrievable lost beyond all possibility of hope
Good God exclaimed Standfast with terror in his countenance whence can this unexpected blow have come It is no diminution of your fortune my lord
Of my life of my soul of my honour returned my lord Oh that I had listened to thy advice Heavenly God that a man should murder his peace sell his lifes happiness and render himself despicable for the brutal villanous gratification of a single moment Will you know the extent of my misery the giddy precipice on which I stood and frightful abyss into which I am plunged Will you know my torment my horror my despair my hell
Be calm my lord said Standfast
with the utmost commiseration he could convey into his countenance
Calm replied his lordship yes when I have destroyed myself when the wretches have added my death to the destruction of my peace of mind
Wretches What wretches cried Standfast eagerly
Keep me not on this wrack of suspence lest my friendship take the alarm and I yield to my fears of that fatal evil which my boding heart has so long anticipated
Hear the truth then said my lord and let all worthy men like thee detest me while I utter it I have lain with that infernal woman she has communicated to me a damned disease and I have infected my dear my innocent wife that excellent creature that pattern of her sex beyond all example who never had a blemish on her heart or understanding but when she joined her unhappy fate to a worthless wretch like me
Angels of pity comfort me said Standfast—Ah my dear lord why did I go this curst journey into the country If I had been on the spot I am sure I should have saved you
It would have been useless cried my lord starting from a chair into which he had thrown himself I had ceased to confide in you before you left town and was glad of a pretext to get rid of your solicitation
Mr Standfast now uttered a most warm and pathetic speech lamenting general depravity and deploring most affectingly his friends want of resolution So excellent indeed were his reasons his remarks so heartfelt and his manner so persuasive that my lord declared there lived not his equal—To say truth this speech had its merit and so it ought for like many other speeches which are intended to surprise instead of convince it had been some time in preparation And now the tutor entreated to know the particulars of this unfortunate business desirous perhaps of being satisfied whether his actors had performed their parts in the manner he had set down for them especially as he had such an opportunity of hearing their respective merits from a critic who would be sure to do them justice
My lord briefly told him that being informed by Colonel Tiltly and some others that a gentleman named Snaffle was traducing him in every coffee-house where he came and that one of his friends who vindicated him had very nearly got into a duel on his account he made it his business to seek after Snaffle but found only the sham sister as before who it was plain was instructed to play upon him At length he found his man at home when matters were very handsomely explained and he was idiot enough to stay to supper The presence of the sister and the bumpers with which he was drenched produced the rest
But concluded my lord that a set of people should conspire the ruin of a man so little known to them and work the destruction of his peace of mind is a species of wickedness and depravity that I cannot give either motive or name
My dear lord cried Standfast impatiently I see a gleam of happiness here a celestial and benignant ray of hope
What do you mean exclaimed Lord Hazard
These people cried Standfast have reaped no pecuniary advantage from their villany
How should they said his lordship
No none—it is a contrivance then cried Standfast of Mrs OShocknesy God send she may be disappointed
Heaven and earth cried my lord you have certainly divined the truth it is that diabolical wretch sure enough who else could have taken such unheard of pains to make me miserable I knew I felt thou wouldst comfort me But still is not the calamity the same my dear Standfast
Not at all my lord answered his kind friend very confidently Are you sure of what you say in relation to your lady
From what I may reasonably conjecture it must be so said my lord Oh God if I could but flatter myself there
Well well hope for the best cried Standfast You forget my lord how artfully the snare was laid for you I am sure if your lordship was off your guard there is no prudence but may be surprised My advice is this If for the sake of your ladys health matters should require an explanation honestly give it her and lay the blame upon Mrs OShocknesy I would stake my life upon the issue And now my lord throw off your chagrin I dare say your lady knows no uneasiness upon this subject but that which she has felt from seeing you miserable
She shall see me so no longer then said my lord By imitating thee I will grow honest and that shall teach me to be chearful
Having so far adjusted matters Lord Hazard felt himself wonderfully relieved As for Charles all he could learn from his mother was that her lord had for several days appeared very ill and very uneasy that it certainly was caused by some disagreeable news he had heard
but continued she whatever it is we must unite to comfort him I am sure from me he deserves every thing for his affection encreases every day
Charles convinced he was the cause of his fathers unhappiness took leave of his mother as early as he decently could to go in quest of Standfast that common friend in the family for surely it is the office of a friend to make people easy
The tutor was ready to receive him and apparently anxious to put him out of pain for he seized him very cordially by the hand and told him matters were in such a swimming train that he had only to appear as if nothing had happened and he might be assured that his father would not even mention the circumstance
Standfast had now restored the tranquility of both father and son and in some measure his own for the latter part of his conversation with his patron was concerning Lady Roebuck but as he could not gather any reason to believe she had been tatling he fairly concluded she was afraid to attack him or else perhaps as chance had thrown him again in her way the lady had wisely adopted the proverb better late than never and so promised herself the accomplishment of what his vanity induced him to believe she wished so difficult is it for men of Mr Standfasts turn of mind to credit that any one can be actuated by motives purely generous and merely disinterested
The triumphant Mr Standfast however had never been so near detection as while he was absent That conversation between the two ladies which took a different turn as the reader has seen at the end of the seventh chapter had introduced into the mind of Lady Roebuck a number of alarming fears for her friend She could not give Mr Standfast that implicit credit which he seemed to exact of Lord and Lady Hazard for the active part he had taken in the business of Miss Snaffle Indeed knowing from her own experience how little pretensions he had either to gratitude principle or generosity her tongue was very reluctantly reined in whenever she heard any thing in his commendation but at length considering Lady Hazard was a new though a very intimate acquaintance and that the office she longed to undertake was rather a thankless one she took a little time for reflection during which interval a circumstance happened which decided her wavering resolution As however it was of sufficient consequence to require that Sir Sidney should be consulted the reader is of course anxious to know what it was and the result of their deliberations The latter I am very ready to say was that to arm Lord and Lady Hazard against the machinations of Mr Standfast was treading on very tender ground and therefore they ought not to take any material steps in so weighty a business till their arrival in the country where Sir Sidney said he would begin this Herculean labour This then they resolved As to the circumstance which procured this resolution it will come better hereafter To have mentioned it here would have been premature and not to have said something on the suspicions of Sir Sidney and his lady would have been tacitly to have accused the reader of a deficiency in penetration for it is hardly possible that any one who knew Mr Standfast should believe him capable of devoting himself so suddenly to the practise of real virtue when his whole life had been an artful study how to keep up the appearance of it
Standfast has been seen very solicitous to get at the particulars of Lord Hazards unfortunate intrigue for which I have assigned the real motive and to say truth he was not pleased with the relation for in his absence—to carry on the allusion I used at that time—his peice had been mutilated by the managers and ill performed by the actors a material incident had been cut out of his projecting and another by no means condusive to the catastrophe he wished to take place introduced—These alterations were principally owing to the heroine who in real life as well as upon the stage is generally apt to take these sort of liberties and though Mr Standfast had not been present at the representation of his performance yet being a consummate judge of effect he saw plainly it would have had more striking success could he have been on the spot to have conducted it
To drop this allusion Standfast plainly saw that Mrs OShocknesy had taken the liberty to alter his plan no doubt for private ends of her own He had left orders for an anonymous letter to be sent to Lady Hazard on the very evening his lordship should be engaged at Snaffles apprizing her of the fact This it was plain to Standfast had been neglected but that something as we before observed should be substituted in its place the lady had through the means of Miss Snaffle conferred a favour on his lordship which she thought would serve just as well to communicate the secret to Lady Hazard To say truth this was a
coup de grace
which Standfast with all his rascallity had not meditated It was a vengeance truly feminine and greatly worthy the vindictive Mrs OShocknesy—How these conspirators answered their conduct to their ringleader will by and by be seen At present I shall only say that Mrs OShocknesy defended herself by an argument which will at least prove her to be a proper coadjutor of the great Mr Standfast It was no less than that the knowledge of Lady Hazards pregnancy induced her to take that harmless step before mentioned without her principals privity at which he was as much incenced as was Hecate against the witches who dared to prompt Macbeth in his iniquity without her orders
CHAPTER XI
PERMANENT HAPPINESS APPEARS TO BE RESTORED AND THE WHOLE SOCIETY SET OUT ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THE COUNTRY
IT will now be proper to speak concerning Miss Le Clerc whose whole history as far as Mr Ingot knew it Sir Sidney learnt much about the time the two ladies were reading Emmas letter for the good citizen being as I observed Lord Hazards man of business they were in a manner obliged to consult him upon several points relative to the property of Little Hockley On the first of these visits every thing naturally came out and when the baronet and his lady met both were ripe for the discovery of what was no secret to either
The story of Annette was no mystery but it has been shewn in what way it was told and if Miss Le Clerc was Sir Sidneys wife what then was Lady Roebuck This was a consideration of a most serious nature and in justice to so amiable a lady it was admitted that it ought to be set to rights—Lord and Lady Hazard being therefore the only persons who had it in their power to make a single comment on this subject and that nobleman and his lady having by this time for many reasons become great favourites with these two friends they were without the alteration of a single circumstance informed of the real truth This led to the establishment of a most intimate and binding friendship between the two couples and the baronet and Lady Roebuck felicitated themselves upon the certainty as they now conceived it of that plan which they had formed of making Lord Hazard the reformer of his own village As preaching however cannot have half the effect of example they resolved as the reader has seen to reserve their grand attack till they should arrive at the place of action when his lordship should be assailed in such a manner as would deprive him of the means of defending himself and oblige him—especially as his lady was already gained over—to surrender at discretion
Lord Hazard very soon got perfectly restored to health and as there were no reasons to believe that his suspicions concerning his lady had any foundation he by degrees regained his usual ease and tranquility
As to Charles he received a quire of letters from Miss Figgins full of
sythes and wows and flamming arts
but convinced that under the guidance of Standfast all he incurred was a trifling expence he rather felt proud of the business and was not a little pleased that at an age under eighteen he had given such notable proofs of his manhood He felt however very gratefully towards both his parents who he was convinced knew of his irregularity and had the kindness not to upbraid him with it and as this imaginary conduct of theirs induced him to treat them with the most dutiful and minute attention so it endeared him to their notice and regard ten times stronger than ever Sir Sidney was not an idle spectator of this He was charmed with Charles and really began to meditate seriously that alliance which it may be recollected he mentioned formerly in jest
These projects which were intended to blossom in the spring and produce fruit in the summer laid at present dormant in their minds we will therefore pass over the hurry of the winter and bring them to the sign of the John of Gaunts Head an inn in their way to Warwickshire
The landlord of this house who was a great favourite of Sir Sidney prided himself on having as distinct and ample a genealogy as any lord nay he looked upon himself as superior to many who boast that title for said he
What are lords the creatures of yesterday to those in my family of three hundred years standing adding alack a day human creatures are buckets in a well one up and tother down
This landlord was not a little proud of having been a substantial yeoman of Kent He had been indeed a considerable farmer but having a strong inclination to indulge himself in that hospitality in which it was not within his circumstances to cut any tolerable figure he had entertained so many poor gentlemen of high extraction till at length as the phrase is he ran out and leaving off farming left also his own country and took an inn not far from High Wickham
The house bore all the insignia of its masters fancied consequence and the reliques of those mighty deeds which were performed by his ancestors and in which he took so much pleasure as he sat in his chimney corner to record were distributed about wherever he could find a place for them Shields and spears glittered in the kitchen instead of potlids and spits helmets and cuisses in the place of stags horns adorned the hall and mismatched pieces of tapestry covered the walls of every room
Lord Hazard insisted upon being introduced in form and Sir Sidney undertook to be gentleman usher upon the occasion My lord confessed he could boast but of very recent extraction being as one might say a junior branch of the nobility
Why truly answered the landlord you will pardon my jocularity my lord there is a spot of
Rust
on your eschuteon which perhaps by
Hazard
may be rubbed out
The archness as well as frankness of this reply pleased his lordship so much that he entered into a long conversation with the landlord that ended in an explanation of all the warlike trophies before mentioned the history of which contained a kind of summary review of the history of England we shall therefore forbear to recite any part of what passed except one remark They were examining a rosary which was said to have belonged to the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots My lord said that hers was a lamentable fate
Lamentable said the landlord shaking his head if she had not been an angel upon earth Bess would not have been so ready to send her to make one in heaven
CHAPTER XII
A NIGHT SCENE WHICH MR FLUSH WOULD HAVE CALLED A VERY VARIETOUS KIND OF A THING
AT the inn where our travellers lay had arrived two musicians just before dark who were going to a noblemans scat in the neighbourhood upon a summer excursion and where there was to be a grand concert the next day One of the gentlemen an Italian had the day before been seized with a violent fever but being told that his patron had sent express for him he determined to go in spight of his indisposition especially as he knew he should be taken greater care of at the house of his benefactor than at home His companion came to acquaint him that he had received a similar summons This put the finishing stroke to the Italians determination for they were both famous performers on the trumpet and seldom played asunder
At this meeting the two musicians talked about what fishing and shooting they should have and above all what delicious burgundy they should taste at his lordships nor did they fail to enjoy by anticipation certain jokes which the Italian being a wag had it in contemplation to play some of his lordships retinue One in particular he concerted which was to ridicule a black servant for whom the Italian had an inveterate aversion because he could not blow the french horn in tune
Perdio cried he I tink I see de villain cavaliero vid his vite orse and plack visage make one tammed nise oh Diavolo
For it should here be known that his lordship though he had constantly a troop of musicians after him and some of them men of distinguished talents would rather have been called in at the death of a fox by the dissonant belching of his favourite horn than have listened to the best chorus of HANDEL performed by five hundred and fifty-three persons capable of realizing all that celestial rapture of which Doctor BURNEY dreamt
The English musician took his leave of the Italian recommending him to take as much rest as possible before they should set off In conformity with this advice the Italian betook himself to sleep and passed the night in tolerable tranquility except that he had a slight delirium in which he fancied the above mentioned black pursued him on his white horse and that he escaped from him with great difficulty and much more such stuff evidently the effect of a distempered brain Having however shook off the phantom he afterwards obtained tolerable repose and felt himself pretty well recovered when his friend the English musician came to call him up
I thought it necessary to premise thus much that the reader might the better account for a disturbance that happened at the inn The house was buried in a total silence when the Italian whose distemper had received no mitigation from either the journey or a shower of rain which had fallen in the afternoon all of a sudden awoke from a horrid dream in which his inveterate enemy the black appeared to him on his steed as before but with the addition of a large sabre with which he threatened to put him instantly to death
Frightened at the spectre like Chamont he rose and called for lights which indeed he need not have done for there was a solitary candle glimmering in the chimney corner by the help of which imperfect luminary every thing could faintly be discerned Leaping from the bed the first object his eyes encountered being a figure in the tapestry of Edward the black prince mounted upon a white horse and giving directions at the battle of Poictiers he ran in a most frantic manner along the gallery and owing to his corpulent form—which extremely resembled a brandy keg or a ninepin made a rapid descent to the hall underneath There being in total darkness he groped about for a considerable time to no purpose in hopes of finding a door into the yard
All this time the fever being at an alarming height every thing he touched seemed to be the falling stroke of that monstrous instrument of death wielded by the figure in the tapestry At length bellowing like a bull and bounding from one table to another like a tost pancake or a kicked football he discovered as he imagined the door A faint glimmering of light that beamed on him facilitated this welcome idea and he strove but in vain to find the lock Exploring this impervious gloom which as far as his scattered recollection gave opportunity to notice appeared the seat of sorcery where all the demons of hell were assembled to torment him for as to being in an inn it never once occurred to his imagination something that felt like down and smelt intolerably bitter fell about his ears and tormented him the more in proportion as he attempted to defend himself from it And now having his eyes nose and mouth pretty well filled with this suffocating annoyance which contrary to the air-drawn dagger of Macbeth was sensible only to the feeling he stampt rubbed his face raved sputtered and struggled till at last he got out of the vortex of this den of Erebus to which he seemed to have been drawn by a hellish and invisible influence
Lifting however his hands in an extreme of distraction—indeed exactly as St Paul is drawn preaching at Athens—something tumbled from above which fitted himself completely like a coat of armour without the casque or cuisses
Fully persuaded the demon that pursued him had now got him in his clutches he stormed howled foamed and squeaked out as incongruous and inarticulate a recitative as ever Hannibal or Scipio did at the opera house
At this moment one of the waiters who had been to pay a visit to the bed chamber of the cook maid Molly and who of course was the most watchful in the house entered the hall with a lighted candle
The Italians singular jeopardy was occasioned by his mistaking the chimney for the door There struggling to get out he had made himself as black as a soot bag and upon his retreat fairly invested himself in the strange manner above mention with a buff jerkin which my landlord had received as a legacy from his father who affirmed and verily believed that it was the same worne by Guy Earl of Warwick when he killed the dun cow
No sooner had the waiter seen this precious relique of his masters ancestors in the hands or rather on the back of the Italian than taking him for a thief who wanted to rob the house he ran to fetch his master The Italian to be even with him upon descrying the light and an opposite door at the same time ran rapidly up another pair of stairs His precipitate flight confirmed the waiter in his suspicions and facilitated his return to his master who by this time alarmed by the noise had just issued from his apartment
The landlord having heard the matter from his man swore by the glory of his forefathers he would cut him up alive and invoking the manes of Edward the black prince and John of Gaunt followed muttering curses all the way to the chamber of the English musician whither the Italian had by accident directed his flight and to where his distracted bellowing piloted both man and master
In the mean time the Italian had reached his brother professors apartment and hid himself buff jerkin and all under the cloaths The Englishman disturbed by the noise and still more by the Italians flouncing into bed waked in an instant and before he had time to recollect what could occasion so extraordinary an intrusion saw in a confused manner by the help of the light which dimly gleamed through the passage what a strange hedious figure he had in bed with him on which he had no sooner cast his eyes than in a dreadful fright he all of a sudden leaped from the bed and got under it
The Italian who began to perceive the light and concluding his companion had seen the man and horse which he had no doubt still pursued him followed him close at his heels being under the bed almost as soon as him The English musician being pressed hard by the same abominable figure half dead with the fright crawled out on the opposite side which happened to be next to the door still followed by the Italian
The landlord and the waiter now came up with them and the candle being produced the appearance of this quadrumvirate was beyond the power of tongue or pen to describe The distraction of the Italian the astonishment of his companion the paralytic fear of the landlord who spight of the examples of his ancestors trembled from head to foot and the consternation of the waiter composed in their different countenances such a set of unbrageous olive livid and cadaverous tints as surely no faces ever before exhibited
The English trumpeter as he encountered the landlord was overturned and now lay flat on the floor The descendant of Hengist had gathered himself up into a grotesque attitude looking at the fallen musician and the waiter was pushing the candle forward under his masters arm to see what was the matter while the Italian had crept to the other side of the bed and having searched for something to defend himself catched up his companions trumpet who had brought that instrument into his chamber to have it safe With this weapon he leapt upon a chest of drawers and whether he was now wrought to such a height of phrenzy as not to know what he did or whether instinct conducted the trumpet to his mouth without his knowledge certain it is that his stretched companion had scarcely demanded what was the matter and the landlord thundered out a volley of execrations ending with
give me my jerkin
than the Italian sounded a charge and then a defiance and then a parley as fast as they could succeed each other
The moment the English musician heard the trumpet he knew his friend as well as if he had spoken to him and instantly guessed that the confusion must have been occasioned by the Italians illness who had become delirious and thus alarmed the house
Feeling however for the safety of his trumpet which same provident sensation impelled the landlord in relation to the Earl of Warwicks habiliment they both approached him where he stood trumpet in hand like another fame in a buff jerkin and were within an inch of their prey when the Italian fairly made a spring over their heads darted out of the door and ran along the gallery then down stairs afterwards out of the back door into the yard and lastly all over the village blowing away almost without any cessation
This was a partial last trump to the village for all but those in their graves immediately started up to see what was the matter As to the inn imagination never formed so singular a confusion The musician raved for his trumpet the landlord stormed for his buff jerkin here a waiter appeared with his cloaths tumbled into the tail of his shirt which he held by way of an apron there a maid servant with a petticoat tied about her head instead of her waist here John the ostler appeared in Sukeys night cap and Sukey in Johns wig—In short there was not one person in the house—for all agreed to put o
manly firmness and meet in the hall together—even to Sir Sidney and Lord Hazard that did not cut a ludicrous figure while the village cried out some a fight others a fire and all with hasty steps ran towards our inn which thus in a few minutes was filled in addition to its own company with the major part of the village among whom were not a few females with clouts about their heads and children in their arms a sort of spectators who are sure to be foremost at every sight be it a boxing match a lord mayors shew or an execution
The English musician getting upon the great table now begged to be heard and having at last obtained silence very naturally accounted for every thing that had happened finishing with a declaration that he apprehended the Italian must now be so far gone that the landlords jerkin and his trumpet were certainly in danger of being spoiled
Far gone cried a country fellow why I zeed un myzel at the back of Master Clovers barn and thats only behind thick here orchard Oons do but list a tiny bit dost not hear un
I do exclaimed the musician I do and my dear trumpet is as sound as ever Zounds I know what I will do shew me to his bed chamber
—at which he jumped down and so scampered up stairs that the spectators began to fear lest he should be infected with the same phrenzy as his companion A very few seconds however brought him back again with the Italians own trumpet hollowing out
This will do this will do here is that shall bring him back again
He now hastened to the yard door and putting the trumpet to his mouth sounded a defiance which was immediately answered at a distance In his next essay he was answered somewhat nearer Upon two or three repetitions the Italian came down the street sounding all the way a parley till at last he was caught held fast brought into the house and the trumpet and buff jerkin restored to their respective owners As to the poor devil himself he was an object of the truest compassion His eyes darted fire he foamed at the mouth and raved like a bedlamite
At the desire of his friend the Italian was conveyed to his bed which in a most emaciated condition he made shift to leave in somewhat less than five weeks

BEING AT LEAST A MATCH FOR THOSE WHICH ARE GONE BEFORE
CHAPTER I
WHICH WILL SHEW THAT THE SNAKE WAS SCOTCHED—NOT KILLED
As I intimated at the end of the first volume that the pranks of the mad musician extraneous as at first sight they must appear had relation and very strongly too to the main and most material part of my design so I shall now proceed to shew in what way
The reader will allow me that according to the letter of my description which really did not outgo the fact the bustle at the inn must to strangers and particularly ladies have been alarming to a great degree and when it is considered that Lady Hazard was seven months gone with child it will not appear very extraordinary that terrified in so unexpected and particular a manner it should have such an effect upon her tender and delicate frame as to throw her into labour which it actually did
Mr Standfast upon this news undertook to produce a gentleman of the faculty from London whither he went as fast as a chaise and four horses could convey him accompanied by Charles whose anxiety for his mother was strongly manifested in his heartening and encouraging the postillions My Lord however was not idle There were several towns near at hand and each of them boasted its man-midwife so fashionable was it even then to adopt a custom which the landlord swore—as he stirred the kitchen fire to prepare for the necessary potations upon this occasion—was a disgrace to the English nation a custom to which our ancestors who had nerves that like their bows twanged with strength were utter strangers He said it was a custom originating from sloth and effiminacy that it was one of those blessed improvements towards the annihilation of manliness and becoming decency that our natural enemies did us the favour to introduce every day that it was unmanly and scandalous as well as ignorant and ridiculous for that the most experienced practitioner could not possibly from the nature of the circumstance arrive to any thing comparable to the knowledge of a woman upon such an occasion to whom every possible symptom must be practically known and who—which with our landlord was nine-tenths of his argument—could alone conduct such a particular business with proper decorum
In this temper he sent for a good old lady who he said had been obstetric gentlewoman usher to half the town and never had met with an accident unless from such a combination of natural causes as would have baffled the utmost perfection of art
The old lady who resided in the neighbourhood arrived first and Lord Hazard extremely anxious to procure assistance made no scruple of introducing her to his wife
Ay ay cried the landlord as he poured her out a glass of usquebaugh this is as it should be here my lord is an operator and please you worth a thousand of your men-midwives fellows that I believe would rather have the reputation of getting children than of bringing them into the world I once asked a chap of this stamp what made all the children he produced so cursed rickety—and he answered me with great archness that a man had a right to mar what he made
Notwithstanding the landlords rhetoric he was obliged to pull in his horns when he understood that Lady Hazards case was of so particular a kind that the good old gentlewoman his friend could not venture to proceed in it upon her single judgment Being asked what he said to this he replied he was still right—it happened to be one of those difficult cases which required assistance but yet the gentleman whoever he was would reap great benefit from the old woman who would be able to explain to him all he had to do and from a conviction being a woman that he could not have the smallest conception of
Before morning arrived three gentlemen who had been sent for from different towns and presently afterwards Standfast Charles and an eminent man-midwife from London who upon all such occasions attended her ladyship A number of corks were heard to report their liberty and hot wine possets and other comfortable drinks smoked all over the house yet though the landlord was greatly pleased at what went forward when he cast his eyes upon the medical tribe he could not help remarking that he did not believe there was half so much fuss when king ARTHUR was born
To the last gentleman who arrived the rest of course gave way He immediately visited Lady Hazard and shortly afterwards found it necessary to have a private conversation with his lordship—nor will the reader be greatly astonished though very much shocked to hear that in the course of this conference it came out that the peculiarity of Lady Hazards case originated with Miss Snaffle
Lord Hazards feeling on this occasion was not simply wretchedness it was horror Standfast was called in that the whole might be explained to him in doing which my lord used such forcible language so execrated himself and so extolled the high the transcendent friendship of the tutor that the surgeon who was both a sensible man and a valuable member of society declared he was charmed at the circumstance and should be very happy to cultivate Mr Standfasts friendship
The surgeon being now particularly informed of the case declared that a very disagreeable operation must be performed but he hoped the life of Lady Hazard was not in danger He said he could easily give the matter a turn to the other physical gentlemen who he could plainly see were ignorant pretenders to a profession in which they had neither right nor ability to practice and this he said he conceived materially necessary for the sake of Lady Hazards peace of mind which it would be impossible to preserve if the matter were known to any but himself—it being a practice with these gentry at which indeed they are very expert to injure the domestic as well as the corporeal constitution
Lord Hazard finding that every thing might be managed without confiding to his lady the real cause of her present danger declared he would wait the event with patience and resignation which turned out as the surgeon had predicted the child was destroyed but the lady survived the operation As to the old woman she was sent home as soon as possible for the surgeon agreed so far with the landlord that he feared much more a discovery through her than through his brother professors
It was nearly six weeks before Lady Hazard could be with safety removed during which time her kind friend Lady Roebuck scarcely stirred from her Nor was the baronet less attentive to my lord He had set his heart upon stimulating that nobleman to an emulation of his own conduct when they should arrive in Warwickshire and doubted not as he knew Lady Hazard longed for the accomplishment of so desirable an end when he should explain to his friend how practicable such a task was and how sure and immense the reward he would readily join him in so meritorious an exercise of that liberality which Lord Hazard whatever were his foibles certainly possessed
Pleased with these ideas the time rolled insensibly on for as soon as Lady Hazard could be removed she was for the present conveyed to a house in the neighbourhood which her lord had hired for that purpose and as the company Sir Sidney expected for the summer called of necessity at the John of Gaunts Head in a few days the poet painter and musician made their appearance as well as Sir Sidneys attorney and a clergyman all of whom by invitation were to pass the summer at Roebuck hall
The assembly having now so largely increased parties of pleasure were planned and as Lady Hazards health seemed every day to be more confirmed the general tranquillity was restored
As to my lord his resolution was made and certainly irrevocably Therefore as no worse consequences had happened from his former conduct he rejoiced at the present moment in the same degree as a patient who by a trifling and immaterial mutilation is restored to health and vigour from the morbid effects of a gangrene
The great difficulty with Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck was how to proceed as to Standfast It was impossible to begin their attack on Lady Hazard as it would ruffle her mind in her present weak condition and as to my lord he was so wrapped up in his amiable friend that it would be impracticable as well as highly absurd to attempt at undeceiving him
In this state were matters situated when the clergyman lately mentioned arrived at the inn This gentleman whose name was Friend had been known to Sir Sidney for many years and was not the less esteemed by him for having incurred the displeasure of a bishop because he would not vote against his conscience He was a very learned and what is a great deal better a very sensible man for though he had little of that understanding by which men rise in the world and which according to nine-tenths of mankind is the only mental coin that ought to pass current yet he had a number of old fashioned virtues of no great use but to the owner but to him valuable indeed—such as piety an unsullied conscience a benevolent heart with the addition of a clear judgment an inventive genius and a critical and accurate knowledge of ancient and modern literature
As Sir Sidneys was a kind of house of call to good characters out of employ no wonder this gentleman was sometimes with him His visit at present however was on another account for the baronet to tell the reader the truth was not without hopes of seeing him rector of Little Hockley He had been some time nominated curate and at the death of the present incumbent the living would be in the gift of Lord Hazard That this circumstance which has not been mentioned before may not appear extraordinary I shall now explain how it came about
When Sir Sidney wrote to Lord Hazard as we have seen relative to Little Hockley he little dreamt that his application would have produced all the cordiality that now subsisted between them—On the contrary there was more of delicacy than hopes of success in consulting him at all
To Mr Standfast however he did not conceive he owed any such delicacy and therefore as the right of nominating a curate reverted to the rector at the death of Major Malplaquet disliking the bargain and sale manner in which it had been transacted before he applied in the strongest possible way to the good pastor for the appointment of Mr Friend to that situation namely by making an offer to commute with him for the entire profits of the living at a very handsome price and to pay the curates salary out of his own pocket
The rector who could calculate much better than he could preach entered into the whole spirit of the argument and Mr Friend became to Sir Sidney what Mr Standfast had been formerly to Major Malplaquet This was the reason why Mr Figgins removed to his vicarage who officiating for some short time at Little Hockley while the negociation was pending between Sir Sidney and the rector became known to the baronet and Mr Friend both of whom believed him to be a very valuable young man and Sir Sidney in particular assured him that if he could in future be of any service to him it would give him pleasure
In a few days after the arrival of Mr Friend Standfast had so ingratiated himself into his good opinion that the worthy man was charmed with him Indeed Standfast saw plainly that this was a good medium of recommendation to Sir Sidney whose friendship for some reason or other he was strenuously desirous to cultivate Perhaps as providence appeared to have rescued Lord Hazard from his immediate gripe he had some similar favour in contemplation for the baronet
Certain it is that the damning proof which Sir Sidney and his lady imagined they had against Mr Standfast which was only presumptive began to sink before those positive proofs which seemed every day to announce his reformation from a number of crimes which he made no scruple to say he had formerly committed and this added to the transport he apparently felt at the restoration of that happiness which now began to gild the moments of Lord and Lady Hazard gave this fortunate gentleman such a favourable place in the hearts of all about him that really an accusation to his prejudice though ever so plausibly urged would probably have gained but little faith unless backed by very weighty and indeed undeniable proof against him
These Sir Sidney really had not The utmost he could alledge was that dissipation and those irregularities which Standfast confessed and disclaimed except indeed a strong suspicion of his being concerned in all the business of Miss Snaffle which if this recent behaviour was not hypocrisy amounted
to nothing and which was corroborated only by an intercepted letter and even that—the rest not proved—would also fall to the ground
The proof alluded to was the very letter which Standfast fancied had not been sent but upon further enquiry he found himself mistaken yet as it had made no alteration in Lady Hazard he was convinced it had not been properly delivered and was afterwards confirmed in that opinion when he found it had been given to Lady Roebucks footman
In fact Lady Roebucks servant on that very fatal afternoon delivered her a letter at Lady Hazards where she happened to be waiting for Sir Sidney who promised to meet her there at tea time Lady Hazard was luckily writing letters in her own room and her friend had just taken up a favourite author from which employ being interrupted by
a letter for your ladyship
she without further ceremony opened it and read these words
MADAM
I cannot refrain from acquainting you that your husband has an intrigue with an infamous woman and you will be assured that I tell you truth when my intelligence is proved to you by his staying out the greatest part of this night Probably you may guess the quarter from whence you receive this and as revenge is completely in your power why not obey its dictates in favour of one who will not be ungrateful to your incomparable charms
Sir Sidney who came in while she was yet reading it cried out
So so I have caught you in the fact have I What tender epistle have you there
Only a discovery of your tricks my love said she
Read that but before you see a word remember I tell you it originates with Mr Standfast
As this conduct was no less handsome than usual in Lady Roebuck her husband was neither surprised at that nor at the contents of the letter Indeed they laughed so heartily at it that their mirth served only to double their concern when upon looking at the direction which neither of them had noticed before they saw it was addressed to Lady Hazard
They were now indeed strongly confirmed it came through Mr Standfast and after having insinuated away Lady Hazards time till the lateness of the evening convinced them there was too much truth in the letter they retired and when alone formed that determination which we have seen so resolutely made at the end of the first volume and now almost abandoned at the very beginning of the second
The latter end of the letter Lady Roebuck thought could allude to no other than Standfast for though she had heard of the business of Dogbolt yet she could not avoid looking upon that to be overstrained and that the tutor at the bottom was the object who wanted to recommend himself and indeed Lady Hazard who wished to disguise nothing from her friend did not scruple to say there were times when she had similar suspicions though always upon reflection she was convinced she did him wrong
Mr Standfast being as conseious of all these matters as if he had known their thoughts combatted the effects of those resolutions they had taken in the manner we have seen and thus though continually on the brink of a discovry he traversed the verge of the precipice on which he was placed as securely though not so harmlessly as SHAKESPEAREs peasant upon Dover cliff for the peasant is described as gathering a purifier of the blood while the parson was searching for whatever could inflame and corrupt it
CHAPTER II
A KIND OF WHITE CROW—THREE OTHER CURIOSITIES AND A SAFE ARRIVAL IN WARWICKSHIRE
As we shall have something to do with all those characters which I have lately introduced to the readers notice it may not be amiss if I mention a word or two of each in this place
The attorney whose name was Balance had long been a great favourite of Sir Sidney not because he had a remarkable number of enemies—though that was very often a sufficient reason for the baronet to espouse a mans interest—but because he had great professional integrity and private worth I shall in a moment explain how this gentleman conjured up such a host of foes by saying that he mortally hated roguery though a lawyer Indeed it had been doubted by many of his brother professors whether his odd notions and strange practice did not so decidedly operate against that strongest of all laws custom to the detriment of the general interest that a point might be made to strike him off the rolls For said they very learnedly
as usage has time out of mind regulated laws as usage has established that it shall be lawful for attornies to appropriate to themselves not only the money goods and chattles lands and tenements wives and children consciences peace of mind nay even the liberty and lives of their clients and as this said lawyer Balance absolutely rejects in toto all such general power over his clients shamefully contenting himself with moderate and reasonable recompence from those in whose behalf he has succeeded and scandalously declining to prosecute and pursue to their ruin such as he plainly sees have been already plucked and pillaged till they totter under the weight of their accumulated misfortunes—quere whether by trampling upon custom which is paramount to law and explaining justice and equity to be the same thing which for the better promotion of cavils and arguments have been considered time immemorial to have distinct and different meanings and looked upon as things that ought to be for ever kept separate and apart the said lawyer Balance ought not to undergo a heavy censure of the court for the first offence to be suspended during pleasure for the second and if upon returning to practice he should be found infringing this custom this usage this law this justice this equity a third time then and in that case to be considered as incorrigible and rendered incapable to practise in his majestys courts of justice
No one of these gentlemen however being patriot enough to rise up and rescue the laws from the gripe of so bold an innovator he went on with this illicit practice to the great terror of the pettifogging tribe—many of whom he had caused to be struck off the rolls—and to the admiration of all good men and among the foremost his particular friend Sir Sidney
We come now to the artists These were the same who had visited Roebuck hall for the last three years for though the baronet had formerly made a point of having a new set every season he at last gave up that plan finding upon taking them indiscriminately that he brought home with him little more than a cargo of vanity ignorance and affectation Having searched therefore with great care and met with three a little more to his mind though they certainly were strange kind of oddities he stuck to them and being now accustomed to their singularities and finding nothing in them that exceeded folly they really furnished him with a fund of amusement independant of their professional abilities
The poet Mr Ego by name was at least in his own opinion as much any thing else as a writer He knew every thing and what is very extraordinary better than any body
The painter was a professed satirist his talent lay in caricature and he blended the ideas which were conveyed by his pencil with his conversation
The musician was a striking contrast to the painter for he was as remarkably civil if not servile as the other was severe
I cannot do better than introduce the reader to them as they are sitting over a bottle at the John of Gaunt
You are a devilish severe fellow Mr Musquito said the poet to the painter
I said Musquito not at all—only a sort of a HORACE upon canvass thats all—a bit of a teazer or so—to be sure I can bite as hard as JUVENAL—but why should one torture flies
And why not cried the poet I would not give three-pence for a satirist who could not make any body miserable
Ill try my hand upon him
said the painter speaking low to the musician Then turning to the poet he went on
Well said Ego Well said ipse dixit Well said I b itself I Well said proof positive Well said infallibility Upon my soul Ego you would have made an admirable pope Sir he possesses every personal and mental qualification in the same proportion of excellence compared to others—
as you do shameless effrontery retorted the poet so you see I excel you at your own trade for I have said as severe a thing as ever you did in your life which has the advantage unlike yours of being truth I will appeal to Mr Toogood
To him said the painter a credulous easy foolish good natured—
Ay ay cried the musician abuse my credulity as much as you please but give me credit for my good intentions at least
I do I do said Musquito—
You intend very well I dare say when you praise a mans wisdom and so you do when you praise his folly In short in you human nature has such an advocate that there is scarcely a vice or a virtue that you have not a commendation for
Poor Musquito cried Toogood now upon my soul thy shafts must be terribly blunt when thou canst find nothing better to aim them at than me I own my services are devoted to all who think proper to make use of them
If they are rich answered Musquito drily for you know Toogood why should the poor be flattered—
Plague take you said the musician I was going to say that I wish to be civil to all mankind and if I have in a few trifling instances been mistaken blame nature who thought fit to sow in the garden of life among a plentiful crop of valuable plants a slight sprinkling of rascals and scoundrels In short Mr Musquito I would not give up the luxury of thinking well of mankind to have Mexico for my real estate Peru for my personal and the mines of Golconda for my
menu plaisirs
What the devil would you have me think as you do that every eye is divine into my heart and every hand into my pocket
Neither would be worth while Master Toogood—cried Musquito
Come come said Ego I will finish the dispute This is the fact you Mr Musquito are over suspicious and you Mr Toogood are over credulous I am the man for this world I steer the middle course
This company upon Lady Hazards recovery separated into two parties one of which set off for the seat of my lord and the other for that of the baronet till at length by the ringing of bells and the acclamations of all the inhabitants they were welcomed to Little Hockley and Castlewick
Sir Sidney threw his eyes complacently around him which sparkled with the satisfaction of beholding so many sincere adherents and he did not at that moment a little plume himself upon the hope of seeing his friend in possession of the same solid enjoyment
The meeting between Sir Sidneys friends and Annette was tender beyond expression My lord declared he never saw so sweet a creature Charles thought her handsome but babyish His mind indeed ran upon riper charms for he had so little of the delicacy of love in his composition that he conceived himself a perfect Caesar and having made so many first sight conquests he was yet to learn the pleasure of solicitation
It is a shame to talk thus of a boy of eighteen but really Mr Standfast had so well remembered the conversation that passed between him and Viney previous to his introduction to Lord Hazard that the young gentleman had already experienced the secresy of the very same surgeon whose cautious conduct we were witnesses of in the last chapter This gentleman to say the truth was a perfect HIPPOCRATES As well as the medical skill of that ancient he possessed his prudence for he seemed to adhere to the famous oath of his predecessor in which he enjoined himself to make his patients good his principal aim and that whatever he saw or heard in the course of his practice or otherwise relative to the affairs of life nobody should ever know if it ought to remain a secret
The country and its amusements had infused such pleasure and satisfaction into every member of this society that nothing was seen but cheerfulness—They mustered up a tolerable concert at Sir Sidneys a thousand good humoured sallies circulated in the way of impromptues and epigrams and sketches of each others singularities were handed about to the no small diversion of all but those immediately caricatured Charles was pretty adroit in each way and having a greater licence his strokes were bolder and in every other respect at least a match for the rest In short there was no part of their time unfilled by some pleasure to every persons taste for it was a maxim with Sir Sidney that all was fair in which there was no premeditated mischief As for the rest Mr Friend began to experience very agreeable effects from his efforts at Little Hockley especially as they were seconded by the exhortations of Standfast who they knew had been a great sinner and who now assured them that he was become a great penitent
Thus possessed of every pleasure a smiling country profuse liberality joyful hearts and ingenious heads could produce their happiness would have been complete had it not been damped by the indisposition of Lady Hazard who a short time after their arrival in the country evidently fell into a gradual decline
This in a great measure prevented Lord Hazard from a participation in the general happiness and gave occasionally no little uneasiness to Sir Sidney and Lady Roebuck My lord however in proportion as he shunned the general hilarity courted the charms which he found in private meditation and the exercise of that benevolence to which he was so forcibly stimulated by Sir Sidney
CHAPTER III
THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW GUEST—AND THE DEPARTURE OF AN OLD ONE
MATTERS wore this face when Charles who had been in continual anxiety relative to the situation of Miss Figgins saw her brother one morning ride into the park It was about the time when the young gentleman flattered himself he should become a father and having accosted Mr Figgins who returned his salutation with bare civility he was convinced this manly achievement of his had been crowned with the expected success Relying however on the friendship of Mr Standfast he felt rather satisfied than otherwise on the subject and immediately appeared as coldly civil as the young clergyman
Mr Figgins was shewn to Mr Standfast with whom he held a long conference the result of which our hero waited for with impatience and he was not a little astonished when the two gentlemen came towards him in terms of very high altercation
Charles could distinctly hear Standfast say
Come come this is a little too rascally
Rascally cried the other
Yes replied Standfast for it is impossible that you can be ignorant of her character
—and then seeing Charles said
Here is the young gentleman and I confess his conduct was imprudent enough but sir I tell you once again it was a trap for him and if it had not been for my positive injunction so honourable are his sentiments he would have disgraced his family for ever by marrying your sister whom I can prove to be a woman void of reputation To tell you the truth sir this was the cause of my silence and as I am convinced you must have been privy to the whole business you need not expect any further countenance from my lord the bishop or any other of my friends
Mr Figgins declared that if Mr Standfast could in the smallest degree prove what he asserted he should abandon his sister as a wretch unworthy his protection He protested his total ignorance of her character and solemnly assured Mr Standfast he knew nothing of the intrigue between her and our hero till—seeing her palpably in a condition that would shortly bring disgrace on him particularly because of his profession and connections—he taxed her with the fact and she with great unwillingness discovered to him what had passed He uttered a very florid speech on the subject of ingratitude and declared he should detest himself if he could be capable even was his benefactor—meaning Mr Standfast—to withdraw his countenance and protection for ever from him to meditate any return that could militate against those honourable sentiments of pure and grateful acknowledgment which were eminently his due
Mr Standfast confessed till this business he had always considered him as a very thankful proper decent grateful young man—nay he might recollect he had given hints that there would be no objection to count upon his future favour and really if he could acquit himself—
Will you suffer me to speak said Charles
As to Mr Figgins I most sincerely beg his pardon for the irregularity I was guilty of in his house That he should know any thing of it is morally impossible because his sister told me that she sincerely believed he would be the death of her if he found it out and I assure you this has at times given me so much anxiety that if I had not promised you Mr Standfast upon my honour—which I hope will ever be a sacred pledge with me—to leave the whole to your discretion I certainly should long ago have written to Mr Figgins and laid all the blame on myself where it certainly ought to fall I am very happy to have this opportunity of coming to so proper an explanation and will readily abide by the determination of Mr Standfast in relation to my future conduct
My dear Charles said Standfast your conduct in this as in every thing else is perfectly handsome Perhaps my zeal for your honour and that of your noble father has hurried me too far and induced me to treat Mr Figgins with more harshness than he merited I will take his word for what he asserts because really as I said before there has always been something about him like ingenuousness gratitude and a proper sense of obligation
—Here Figgins bowed—
If therefore matters go in the old train as to him I beg that it may extend to his sister
This is the point I wanted to come to said Charles I assure you we were both betrayed into what we did for neither of us originally meant more than a very harmless gratification
Oh yes said Standfast Come come Charles you might be a Lubin but she was no Annette I assure you No no Figgins added Standfast taking Charles by the hand my pupil here whom I hope to see a duke is no match for your sister even were there not that bar which I will hereafter convince you subsists In the mean time let the bantling come forth and be brought up—we will find a provision for it
Mr Figgins was now invited to spend a few days in the family to which he consented Indeed the time passed so agreeably that a fortnight had elapsed before he ever dreamt of taking his leave Charles during this interval became very intimate with him and Mr Friend and the good Mildman—which last declared he began to have hopes of Little Hockley the moment the young gentleman had appeared among them—were charmed with his society
Nor must the reader who knows his origin too hastily credit that I am advancing any thing unnatural or unlikely Art does not require brilliant talents and no people in the world are so easily imposed upon as good men Pay but a modest deference to your own opinion that you may not seem too servile struggle a little with conviction before you appear to yield to it and though you give up points with reluctance never fail in the end to crown your adversary with the palm of victory— and be assured of friends wherever you choose to make them
Standfast knew mankind surely This young man was bred up under him and as he had strong intellects rather an engaging figure a retentive memory a wonderful natural penetration a collected and shrewd sagacity with a fortunate knack of chequering his conversation with bits and scraps of philosophy and morality which he had studied it is not at all astonishing that he should be mistaken for a sensible and good man by such as could they have discovered any defects in him would rather have excused than exposed them
Mr Standfast one day having received some letters from London came to my lord and informed him that his uncle was at the point of death Of this uncle Lord Hazard had heard him speak and always understood he had great expectations from him He therefore begged that no time might be lost but that the tutor should instantly set out to see his relation This was the more readily agreed to because Mr Figgins could stay to superintend his pupils studies which indeed now consisted of nothing more than reading and comparing different authors a part of which exercise he pleasures of the country took off not to reckon nis attention to painting and music in both of which he was a great proficient
These preliminaries adjusted Mr Standfast took his leave of his good friends in Warwickshire and repaired to London from whence in a short time afterwards he informed Lord Hazard that his uncle being dead he was left independant but that he should still consider him as his benefactor and would as soon as he should have settled his affairs wait on him He anxiously enquired after Lady Hazard whom he had left in a very declining state of health hoped his pupil was pleased with Figgins whom he took the liberty to recommend as his tutor while he should need a person in that capacity and offered to relinquish in his favour that annuity which his lordship had settled on him for life
My lord replied in a suitable manner to this letter He wished his friend joy of his good fortune drew a melancholy picture of Lady Hazards situation enlarged most pathetically on his own treatment of her solemnly declared if he should lose her all his happiness would be at an end consented with pleasure to his proposal concerning Figgins but positively refused—though he was determined to take care of the young man—to suffer the smallest restitution of that which he Standfast had infinitely more than deserved—winding up the whole with a strong contrast between the great and exalted merit of his friend and his own unworthiness
In the mean time the summer was gliding away during which scarcely a day passed that did not bring with it some new pleasure but yet Lady Hazards indisposition was a cloud that dimmed this serene sky As most of these amusements however were calculated for the alleviation of her pain especially those which Charles conducted—for he doated on his mother—their enjoyments suffered but little diminution on her account In the mean time our heros sentiments changed insensibly every day in favour of Annette though really his heart was yet a perfect stranger to the delicious sensations of delicate love and those he did feel young as he was upon so proper an occasion he well knew how to suppress He had some warm thoughts certainly as to Emma and knowing as much of books as herself he very archly conceived a design of conquering her with her own weapons but finding her virtue too well fortified to yield to his solicitations he made an honourable retreat greatly to her satisfaction who was not in the least angry for virtue with her was slender indeed that could not withstand every trial On the contrary she ventured to predict that Annette was his destined wife but foresaw his imprudence would cost many a mutual heart ach before the accomplishment of their destiny
Charles certainly had not the smallest objection to consider Annette in the light of an intended wife nor was he by any means as I have already said insensible to either her beauty or accomplishments and therefore—especially as he had the sanction of both his and her parents—he paid her the exactest attention and lost no method nor opportunity of inspiring her with sentiments highly to his advantage But he had ever set his heart on seeing the world and that not superficially before he should sink into a domestic character which he always conceived would be a clog to the exertions of a volatile mind like his unless he could be assured by repeated experience that his partner for life was possessed of those many and scarce attractions which would so bind his inclinations as to make him prefer bondage to liberty
The attention he paid Annette had however a different effect on that young lady Their little pleasures were it is true not more than the sports of children but there was such an unaffected ease such sweetness of temper such an engaging and so insinuating an address in our hero without the smallest tincture of art or illiberality that without her own knowledge she imbibed the seeds of that poison which according to Emmas prediction was destined to give her many a bitter pang
Little Hockley was now improving very fast—Mr Balance had routed the two attornies I formerly spoke of who upon examination were found to have practised without the smallest qualification The painter had completed a picture of the return of the prodigal son which was placed in a conspicuous part of the church and the musician had opened a fine organ the gift of Sir Sidney under which the poet affixed a very elegant latin inscription which Emma said ought to have been in English
It had been an invariable custom to celebrate the baronets birth-day by throwing open the doors of the mansion house and feasting all comers In the afternoon several sports were performed on the green and in the evening the company retired to a very large rustic assembly-room where Sir Sidney always opened the ball and after he had seen that his tenants and neighbours had every thing they could wish for to give their pleasure free scope he retired with their warm and unfeigned good wishes for a continuance of his health and happiness
Since Sir Sidneys marriage however this festival had been kept on his wedding day and this was called the grand feast—for there were three others to celebrate the birth-day of himself that of Lady Sidney and that of Annette But these happening near each other and Sir Sidney not choosing to fill his tenants heads with too profuse an inclination for pleasure he held these festivals on the four quarter days when he never failed to lighten the hearts of those who from unavoidable necessity could not be punctual with their rent
There was something so remarkable in the conduct of the day which united the two villages that I shall take a fresh chapter to describe it flattering myself that no one will blame me for dwelling upon a subject the fittest that can be to produce benevolent ideas
CHAPTER IV
A JUBILEE OF HEARTS
CARDS of invitation containing the following words were in due time circulated at the houses of the neighbouring gentry
Sir Sidney Roebucks grand feast will be celebrated on Monday next the st of June at which the presence of
is cordially requested
Stewards
Rt Hon Lord Hazard
Charles Hazard Esq
Rev Mr Friend
The company is expected to arrive on Sunday evening and not to depart till Tuesday morning
The combined assistance of all who could be useful was solicited upon this occasion The poet painter and musician produced a masque in conjunction and Charles wrote and set an ode as well as painted the decorations for it and it was allowed—though that might be the companys partiality—to be the completest performance of the day
Lord Hazards department was to receive the company and accommodate such as could not find room at Sir Sidneys Charles had the management of the amusements and Mr Friend assisted by Mildman and Figgins undertook to preserve decency and decorum The company which arrived on the Sunday evening were served in the apartments provided for them and permitted to sup and retire at their own time
At six oclock on the Monday morning the two villages were awoke by ringing of bells a discharge of cannon and other demonstrations of joy This done several messengers were dispatched to request their attendance at a rural amphitheatre fitted up for the purpose in the front of the rookery There by eight oclock the company assembled and after a short but pathetic hymn to the deity had breakfast served up to them by children in white and flesh-colour dresses ornamented with flowers who drew the most delicious beverages from a variety of urns distributed about in niches
Coffee tea and chocolate were relieved by capilaire orgeat lemonade and sherbet while the most odoriferous perfumes mingled their artificial sweets with the roses and jessamine that shed their emanations as they interlaced the surrounding treillage Cakes comfits and liqueurs were seen in great variety and abundance and after the company had amply refreshed themselves during a performance of the most touching and melting airs each Ganemede and Hebe moved a spring and instantly played in the centre of every alcove a fountain of rose water for the use of ablution which ceremony was succeeded by a proclamation that every one was at liberty to take separate diversion till eleven oclock when they were expected on the lawn in order to go to church in procession
This procession though simple was striking It was preceded by twenty-four wool-combers each of whom carried some ornament of their profession Twelve others followed with banners on which were displayed a variety of ingenious devices—Twenty-five inhabitants of Castlewick and as many of Little Hockley succeeded one of each place linked arm in arm in token of brotherly love To these succeeded a band of music—then came the stewards with golden wands who were followed by their assistants with silver ones Lady Roebuck Lady Hazard and Annette came next in an open carriage these were succeeded by a large number of other carriages and these again by about two thousand spectators
Being orderly seated at church the service was performed and an excellent sermon preached by Mr Mildman from the text
There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just persons who need no repentance
The service over they returned in the same order—with this difference—twelve morrice dancers met them on their way and conducted them in a mazy round to the lawn where all dispersed and after promiscuous ambulations about the garden retired to dress for dinner which at three oclock smoaked in the grand saloon for the company within doors and on the lawn for all who chose to partake of it
In the saloon Lady Roebuck held her state and Sir Sidney played the humble host Annette on one side sat with all the blooming freshness of a new blown rose and on the other poor Lady Hazard pallid as a drooping lily On the table was elegantly distributed a most sumptuous feast admirably contrasted and delicately served up Nor did their pleasure receive a small addition from the hearty vacant mirth that assailed them from the lawn—which the saloon overlooked—where sat as many happy guests as could surround an ox two bucks and four sheep all roasted whole at which Emma sat in imitation of Lady Roebuck and the butler—who was the very servant so faithful to Sir Sidney in France—attended like his master to supply the wants of the company
Many loyal toasts were proclaimed by a discharge of cannon and pledged by the company without At length the lawn was cleared coffee introduced into the saloon and in a short time after notice given that the ode written by our hero was going to be performed in the rustic amphitheatre where the company had breakfasted
The saloon was now prepared for the masque to which the company were desired to repair in fancy dresses but without vizors Previous however to the performance as soon as it became sufficiently dark they were led by the morrice dancers through a serpentine walk to the canal where on the opposite bank was discharged a most superb firework in which the painter had exerted himself in ornamental transparencies and the poet in apt devices
The masque over it is impossible to express the universal astonishment when upon returning to the lawn they found it converted into beautiful alcoves tents booths and other receptacles for different parties where boys and girls in the most picturesque fancy dresses ran before them ready to anticipate their very wishes Nothing could exceed the beauty proportion and disposition of this city of the pleasures reared as it were by enchantment Those who were not disposed however to resort to it for refreshment were attended and served in a manner equally desirable in a suite of rooms in the house and as to Emmas company in addition to a review of all these pleasures at a becoming distance they had their own rural assembly room for their supper and ball where I am well informed not one within some hours guessed what it was oclock till the sun sent forth those streaks of crimson which put an end to their harmless merriment on the Tuesday morning
Nor did their superiors separate one whit sooner and not then without regretting that their pleasures were at an end and declaring that they never witnessed such taste nor experienced such hospitality
It may not be improper to notice some of the principal remarks made on this occasion
Annette remarked that Charles looked spoke and did every thing divinely He remarked that she was a lovely little creature and all the company remarked that they seemed born for each other—Emma remarked she had made a conquest of the poet the musician and the butler and well knowing the fidelity of this last to his master and affection to his young mistress declared as she undressed Annette that she should have no objection at a proper season to be the author of his happiness
The poet remarked Emma was a smart wench and should be his for he was the man in the world for her purpose The musician agreed to the first remark but thought they neither of them stood any chance and the painter overhearing them swore she was a caricature of mother Shipton and they were damned fools for talking such nonsense
Lord Hazard remarked that he had now but one wish in the world and Sir Sidney remarked—but not to my lord that this was the first time their grand feast had been graced with the presence of Lady Hazard and he greatly feared it would be the last Indeed that amiable and charming lady lest she should diminish the general hilarity exerted herself on that day beyond her strength and though probably the utmost human care—for she had every assistance that money or influence could procure—could not have wholly restored her yet certainly her now rapid decline was accelerated by the various shocks though of temporary pleasure which she received in assisting to promote the happiness of her friends
CHAPTER V
A DISPUTE BETWEEN EMMA AND THE POET
As this is the only entire summer the reader and I are to pass in Warwickshire I shall explain pretty fully how the time jogged on So far it is pretty evident every mans leisure had been taken up to prepare for the festival which some may think I have a little too particularly described It has however brought about something according to my usual custom for it made Lady Hazard worse which but for the sake of moral truth I sincerely wish had not happened it lost Emmas heart and it did two or three other things which will be divulged in proper time
This grand affair being over the spare time was filled up with lighter and less regular pleasures among which Charles in particular found the contrary dispositions of Sir Sidneys scientific triumvirate excellent food for his frolicksome temper which though it had not the smallest tincture of mischief in it loved to indulge itself with exposing absurdity To this Master Figgins egged him on with all his persuasion with no view however as he said but to oblige the young gentleman nor to say the truth did Sir Sidney want a relish for such fun when every thing was kept within proper decorum
It did not signify what the joke was their argument upon it produced all the amusement Charles very often set the poet down to a literary contention with Emma who being skilled in authorities generally conquered him for really dates and facts are very good materials for criticism and method will very often be too hard for genius Upon these occasions the poet was thrust further into a corner by the satiric painter and consoled by the accommodating musician One afternoon however she gained so complete a triumph that he was obliged for a long time to own himself conquered
The reader remembers that Emma had a very great predelection for Dr JOHNSON and Charles entreated the poet to attack the lexicographer This he did not fail to do but kept for a long time to general accusations Emma desired he would give her some opportunity of answering him
Any man said she may be made to look contemptible ARISTOPHANES contrived this of SOCRATES who because he was a man of inoffensive manners and therefore naturally decried the licentious writings and conduct of the comic poets provoked the fury of this satirist—but even though this is true and though Madame DACIER was so charmed with this author that she translated—and not content with that read two hundred times and every time with fresh pleasure the very piece that was written to render this great philosopher ridiculous—yet it proved nothing because general assertion is a blunt arrow that falls without inflicting a wound
Well what do you say to this cried Figgins who stood by
Say cried the poet If she wants proofs of what I have asserted she shall have them I am the man for adducing proofs And first of all has he not written a severe satire on himself when he says of SWIFT
that on all common occasions he habitually affects a style of arrogance and dictates rather than persuades
In another place
he predominated over his companions with a very high ascendency and probably would bear none over whom he could not so predominate
Now does not Mrs THRALE after a confession that she had surfeited herself with an abject and indefatigable attention to him for a number of years such as no man who did not in a most insolent degree predominate over his companions could exact does she not declare she could no longer bear him and that she went to Bath because she knew he would not follow her Is not Mr BOSWELL every moment frightened to death lest there should be a total breach between them Does not the Doctor meditate an entire separation only because Mr BOSWELL had the imprudence to leave him for a few minutes with truly the shameful intention of contributing to his ease and convenience What do you say to all this Does not this convince you that my assertions are truth
No no sir answered Emma we were to talk of a poet you are speaking of a man
A good evasion said Ego and in the Doctors own way I am the man for seeing what people are about—but come you shall have him as a poet And pray does he not wish to destroy the very being of poetry by insisting on annihilating mythology Does he not find it very reprehensible in Mr GAY to introduce Cloacina and the nightman in his Trivia and does he not abuse poor PRIOR most unmercifully for fabling that Chloe was mistaken one day by Cupid for Venus and another for Diana In short mythology is with him puerility He says of Collins that he loved faries genii giants and monsters and that while he pursued these objects he did not sufficiently cultivate sentiment when all the world knows that there is an end of poetry if sentiment is no longer to be conveyed through so rich and beautiful a vehicle What do you say to this abuse of the gods and goddesses Is not it shameful
No sir said Emma not at all for a man may abuse such imaginary beings without injuring any bodys moral feelings
Another evasion cried the poet I will be judged by any body But I will go a plainer way to work Here is a criticism of his that is stark nonsense In speaking of Mr GRAYs lines on the death of a cat that was drowned as she attempted to catch a gold fish the last line says that all that glitters is not gold nor if it were says the doctor would the cat have been the better for it for a cat does not know the value of gold Now I say she does in the sense it is here meant which is nothing more than that we are not to trust to appearances and a cat knows that as far as her understanding goes as well as a man Can you controvert this Mrs Emma No no I am the man for close reasoning All that glitters is not gold sure enough What do you say to my argument
That it is not sterling sir said Emma
Your learned principal would have given the same vague answer said the poet
Come come why does he take no more notice of COLLINSs ode than if no such poem had ever been written Can you answer me that
Easily sir said Emma it was written for music which he did not understand
It is a pity then said the poet that he did not understand it for he cannot shew such harmony in his own poetry which is the heaviest—
Sir said Emma he was profound
Verbose said the poet
He compiled a dictionary of the English language
answered Emma
Zounds cried the poet you would make a man mad I am a man that is never in a passion but damme madam—
Here every body interfered and it was universally allowed that Emma had gained a complete victory
Yes said Emma still imitating Dr JOHNSON my triumph is complete for if Mr Ego has nothing to say
for
himself the logical conclusion is that all he can say
of
himself must be
against
himself for these are the three distinctions of egotism
This witty warfare stuck hard with the poet for a good while he got off however as well as he could for when the painter with his usual acrimony told him that he ought to hide his head for ever after being conquered by a woman and the musician in his old accommodating manner said he plainly saw Mr Ego had yielded the palm from the abundance of his natural complaisance Ego cried out you are right my dear friend Toogood I am the man that knows how to behave polite to a lady
CHAPTER VI
CONSISTING OF SHAM GHOSTS AND A VALIANT TAYLOR
NOTWITHSTANDING this repulse which the poet sustained from Emma he had really a penchant for her and as she loved reading he flattered himself he should succeed by acknowledging her victory over him in the dispute already mentioned and submitting tacitly to her opinion in all literary matters
This amorous intercourse at least that which appeared so to the musician began to make him a little uneasy for he flattered himself with pretty near the same hopes as the poet Seeing this Charles and his associates hit upon a plan which they thought would afford them some amusement
Charles very archly intimated to Toogood that Emma in her own mind gave him the preference but added he you will lose her owing to your absurd diffidence In short after proper preparatio
he proposed to him a scheme which he said would
evince his love for Emma even without wounding his modesty by declaring it would bring out her real sentiments towards him and would finally frighten Ego into a relinquishment of his pretensions to her
The kind Mr Toogood agreed to the proposal with but little hesitation It was this the associates were to report that the musician had hanged himself for love and to give it a colour while he hid himself in a garret—where by the way they almost starved him under a pretence that nobody could come to him for fear of a discovery—his fiannel powdering gown was put upon a stuffed figure and hung as it were artfully by the neck to a staple in his bed chamber and this was shewn to the poet in the dusk of the evening in a way so well managed that he really took it for the musician
The poet willingly enough ran as he was desired for help and in the interim the powdering gown was shifted from the figure to Toogood himself whose face had previously been smeared by the painter with a composition of a cadaverous hue therefore when he returned and found Toogood stretched upon the bed he had not the smallest doubt but that he had made his final exit Presently afterwards Emma came into the room and being properly instructed for the purpose began to lament her hard fate and to utter so many tender things in favour of the musician—calling him her Orpheus her Amphion—In short she flew into such apparent rapture that Charles and Figgins feared the crotchet-monger would have jumped up and appeased her upon the spot She said this country was now deprived of a second PURCEL but where could they find another DRYDEN to record his praise
Ego answered briskly that DRYDEN to be sure was a very pretty poet but there was one yet in the world he flattered himself as capable of singing the virtues of a deceased friend as most people
Emma took him at his word saying she feared she should never be able to bring herself to love him—though she would try what she could do—yet her friendship he might always command if he would as a last tribute to his friends memory write his epitaph
This settled the company dispersed Charles lifted up his hands Figgins blessed himself the poet in profound meditation Musquito swearing it served the fool right and Emma quite in a tragedy rant The poet desired he might have a slight supper in his apartment and pen ink and paper—The musician who had acted his part very well was locked up and every body retired
Ego was heard for some time to walk about his room in great agitation and afterwards to draw his chair and sit down very still to work In short he had finished the task just at that moment
When church yards yawn
And hell itself breaths forth contagion to the world
Being charmed with his production he began to read it aloud and afterwards was heard to exclaim
I never was so successful in my life Once more—
and then reading—
Here Toogood lies by desprate passion
drove
Who great musician hanged himself for love
He scarcely had uttered these words when open flew the door and the musician appeared in his powdering gown with a halter round his neck exclaiming in a hollow voice
And so I did perfidious poet
The bard like Pierrot—though the musician looked that character more than he did—now began to stare to tremble and without quiting either the paper or the candle blundered to the further side of the bed where the ghost with a most ghastly grin glided after him Seeing himself followed he sprang across the bed at the expence of his shins and out of the door the ghost hard at his heels when hurrying down the stairs—which were strewed with peas unknown to either of them they rolled over each other till they lighted on a feather bed purposely laid at the landing place where all the company in the house burst in at once and found them cuffing one another almost as unmercifully as Mr POPE makes the two eagles in HOMER
The musician began now to perceive that he had been duped as well as the poet Sir Sidney said he was sorry to find the musician had played upon so ridiculous a chord to which Charles answered his performance was perfectly in the amoroso style—Emma said that to be sure he had given a dying proof of his love but not knowing that he would recover she out of despair had chosen another—The painter said it was not the first time Mr Too-good had made himself ridiculous The poor musician getting up laughed the matter off as well as he could He said his known character was to accommodate himself as much as possible to the pleasure of the company and as to the poet he said he suspected it was a trick from the beginning for he was the man at discoveries He swore he would have acted a dead man ten times better and as for a ghost
Damme said he if I had personated a ghost I would have scared you all out of your wits
After a hearty laugh Emma finished the business by a few serious words saying that they had both hung themselves up as marks of ingratitude in return for Sir Sidneys hospitality yet if the ghost of remorse did but haunt them a little for entertaining a wish to injure a poor girl who had nothing to depend upon but her character she should for her own part think them sufficiently punished
A truce was struck and good humour restored or rather prolonged for none of the parties entertained the least rancour on the contrary the musician was the first to confess he had been justly reproved for his error and Ego said he was an admirer of poetical justice which he flattered himself he had exemplified pretty strongly in his writings
About this time a matter happened which had very nearly undone some of Sir Sidneys pious work at Little Hockley One John Swash a miller who was at the head of a large family and one of the first who repented of his former idle tricks had been set up by Sir Sidney and had lived for some time in comfort and credit This man at the instigation of some litigious persons who envied his present good fortune had been taken up for sheep-stealing a crime which he certainly had committed some years before He was to be tried at Warwick at the summer assizes and Sir Sidney greatly feared the fact would be fully proved in which case it would be difficult to save the man
But this was not the worst for a number of the Hockleyites having been guilty of crimes equally enormous might on his conviction emigrate from the village where they began to live peaceable and decent lives and thus he should lose the fruits of that benevolent harvest which he had been so long and so carefully bringing to perfection
There was but one man who could swear to his identity except indeed a companion who having been formerly discharged by a magistrate on account of this fact now appeared as kings evidence to curry favour with the farmer whose sheep had been lost as well as to screen himself from future prosecutions
This man who as I said could swear to him was a taylor and lived at this time in pretty good credit at Wellingborough but had formerly worked as journeyman at a small town not far from Little Hockley and when business was not very stiring there was glad enough to job about at other places and return to his wife and family with the earnings
He had been three days getting ready some mourning for a family in the neighbourhood when being upon the point of returning on a very dark night he was reminded by some officious friend that he must go seven miles about for that over the common which was but little more than three he would certainly meet with the ghost
It must be understood that on this common was erected a gibbet where were hung in chains two smugglers who had murdered an exciseman and under this gibbet every evening were seen—for a great number of the inhabitants within some distance round were ready to swear it—two men in white marching with much deliberation and carrying a coffin
The taylor had frequently heard all this but as it rained a little and the way over the common lay so much nearer than the other he could not think or going round—besides he was perfectly at this time pot valiant and one more glass put the finishing stroke to his resolution
Away went the taylor with his wages in his pocket and his goose suspended on a stick which he held over his shoulder When he came near the gibbet sure enough he saw two men carrying a coffin His sensations may be easily guessed at He was seized with so strong a fit of horror that his teeth chattered his legs shook he trembled from head to foot and sweat at every pore He made an effort to run away but his limbs refused their office At length as the spectre approached with one frantic struggle between fear and desperation his well-poised goose flew from the staff that supported it like lightning and hitting the head of the ghost that was nearest to him brought him to the ground—when lo open flew the coffin and out jumped two sheep
The other spirit unconscious that he had only one-ninth of an adversary to encounter took to his heels and soon disappeared The first however stunned by the blow he had received could not so easily get out of the taylors clutches who being convinced of the fact by the information of the two sheep pursued his victory and actually tied the culprits hands with a large piece of list in order to carry him before a magistrate
The sheepstealer pleaded very hard for his liberty as soon as he came to himself when the taylor knowing his voice presently recognized him for the very same John Swash who now at the distance of almost three years was confined in Warwick jail for this individual offence
The general opinion was that the taylor had compassionated the situation of John for a valuable consideration which was in the nature of a fine to be paid by installments but had not been regularly discharged Finding however that the offender began to be pretty well off in the world the subject was revived and the matter carried by the farmer at the instigation of the taylor to the length we have seen
These were the circumstances which made Sir Sidney uneasy He plainly saw that Swash was picked out not with a view to offer a public sacrifice at the shrine of offended justice but merely to be used as an instrument by way of experiment to see how much money could upon similar occasions be extorted in future—for knowing the baronet to be very warm in whatever he espoused the two pettisoggers who were driven from Little Hockley and a few others who accompanied them counted upon a comfortable subsistence which they had no doubt they could procure by raising contributions in like manner upon the generosity of Sir Sidney
CHAPTER VII
THE SEQUEL OF SWASH AND THE TAYLOR
The difficulty seemed to be how to suppress the evidence of the taylor without Sir Sidneys apparent concurrence for it was not enough that he should not seem to take any active part in the business but it was necessary to regard it as a matter of perfect indifference to him
On this account it was necessary to be very wary in their measures Charles and Figgins however undertook after a very little reflection to remove all difficulties
The plan was explained and greatly approved and now came the time to put it in execution
A house was taken about three miles from Warwick whither Charles Figgins and the body of arts repaired which last were informed that the removal was only temporary to take views and attend the assemblies at the assizes
About a month before the assizes Charles and Figgins rode to Wellingborough The latter having previously rolled his coat in the road and splashed his horse on one side they went to the first inn they saw where they enquired if there was a clever taylor in town who could make a coat at a short warning The landlord recommended one but not the man they wanted but rather than make objections they determined to see him and when he came found fault with every thing he produced which indeed they were determined to do with fifty till they should see the object of their present business At length he came and there never was such a taylor They were struck with his taste his manner his price—In short the poor devil was in raptures though a man must have been very ingenious to find language for this lavish praise in favour of a card of buttons and some snips of cloth So it was however that the taylor never found out half so much merit in himself as at that moment He made his men sit up all night and a very awkward coat was produced in the morning for Figgins which nevertheless was the pink of taste and the extreme of the new fashion and Charles pretended to be so much in love with it that he ordered a frock for himself with the addition of a new Birmingham button with which he declared himself enchanted This frock however he could not stay for It was therefore ordered to be sent to the house of the Rev Mr Figgins near Warwick where it would be paid for on delivery
The taylor said he should be at Warwick at the assizes for he was subpoened there upon a trial and he would then if the gentleman pleased take the liberty of calling to see if he was satisfied with his coat
Figgins said he should be very glad to see him for that he knew no character so respectable as a tradesman This was said as they took horse and the taylor making a very low bow retired The circumstance was however so singular that the landlord as well as the taylors wife set down Charles and Figgins for two cheats and cautioned the taylor not to be taken in
The taylor had himself some suspicions akin to theirs though the flattery that had been lavished on him almost overcame his wariness However to make all sure as he had some business at Warwick—indeed no other than to con his lesson as to his evidence against Swash—he took that opportunity of carrying home the coat himself
Being arrived at Mr Figginss he was very kindly welcomed detained all night paid his bill and informed that more clothes would be sent for to be got ready against the assize ball to which our hero added
I wish we could prevail on you sir to settle here for there is not one of your profession within twenty miles who knows even how to set on a button with taste
The taylor acceeded to the fact took a comfortable portion of merit to himself and went home in high spirits
Swash was to be tried on the last day of the assizes on the motion of the counsel and three days previous to the trial an order was sent to the taylor from our hero for some clothes for the assize ball The taylor could not refuse to execute the order but nevertheless very anxious to be in time for the trial was determined he would be at Warwick the night before
A servant being dispatched to suggest alterations and delays till he should be detained very late that evening he at length arrived clothes and all at Mr Figginss about half an hour past eleven oclock most exceedingly fatigued
Figgins took him very cordially by the hand and led him into a parlour where at near one—the clocks being put back almost an hour—supper appeared The taylor protesting he never was so disposed to make a good meal in his life fell to very heartily Thus the time passed on till within a quarter of an hour of day light though by the clocks—being once more put back—the taylor did not believe it so late by two hours At length he was led to bed completely drunk Having slept till two oclock in the afternoon—which will not appear extraordinary if we consider his drunkenness and fatigue—he awoke without recollecting for some moments where he was When he felt however a fine soft stately bed he began to have some faint idea how he came there but as every thing appeared as dark as pitch he concluded it was in the middle of the night and turned to go to sleep again this after tumbling and tossing for half an hour he effected and taking another pretty good nap waked about half an hour past six
Feeling a violent head-ach and finding himself intolerably hungry he could not help thinking the night remarkably long He got out of the bed and groped about for the windows and having drawn one of the curtains opened the shutters but it was all the same He could not throw up the sash indeed owing as he supposed to a mode of fastening it which he did not understand He was yet convinced however that it was not near day light and therefore determined to go to bed again
In groping out his way he caught hold of the tossel of a bell whieh immediately tingled very forcibly This frightened him out of his wits—How could he apologize in a gentlemans house for making such a disturbance After he had been in bed about a quarter of an hour in anxious hope that nobody had heard the bell a servant came into his room with a candle yawning stretching and rubbing his eyes who asked him what he would be pleased to have
The taylor begged his pardon a hundred times for disturbing him though it was nearly seven in the evening and asked what oclock it was and how long it would be till day light
Oclock sir said the servant why we hant a been in bed above a quarter of an hour I believe there will be a good three hours yet before the cock crows
Three hours cried the taylor why I never passed such a night in my life Three hours—why I seem as if I had lain twenty and then I am so cursed hungry
Ay that is your long journey sir said John
I dont know what the devil it is said the taylor but could not you my dear Mr John get me a bit of something for the tooth
Lord love you no such thing said John you must een stay till morning
Morning cried the taylor why I shall be famished in three hours I never had such a craving in my life
Well well said John then I will see what I can do but I must get the keys of old Mother Search the house-keeper and she is a devil of a crusty toad I can tell you
The taylor implored him to see what he could do and John said he would return directly He did not however make his appearance for another half hour when he brought word that there was nothing to be had
This news the taylor was obliged to swallow instead of the repast he had expected and wishing John a good night endeavoured once more to get to sleep This however was impossible he kicked about turned twisted got up lay down and between whiles fell into a kind of dose till night actually came His patience was now entirely exhausted and for the first time he suspected that some trick had been played him The whole conduct of this family had been so extraordinary that he began now to reflect on his neighbours suspicions but then how could that apply to him—he had nothing to be robbed of They might murder him however but what harm had he done to any body Perhaps it was all a drunken frolic—perhaps it was day-light all this time Whatever it was he might be sure no servant would set him right he was therefore determined to sally forth and know the truth of every thing
So resolved he immediately put on his clothes and groping out the door met with no impediment all the way to the garden where by feeling about he soon found himself Here he gave that credit to the stars which he denied to John and being now convinced his brain was affected he thought he could not do better than return without giving any further disturbance to the family This however was not so easily practicable as he imagined The door had shut after him in such a manner that he found it out of his power to open it
His situation was now truly deplorable He durst not knock for fear of making more disturbance in the house In the mean time he was devoured with hunger and being in a strange place in the night his fancy transformed every bush not into an officer but a ghost
These apprehensions were not a little heightened by a variety of noises which now assailed his ears Clanking of chains groans and howls fixed him petrified to the spot while strange lights which came and disappeared added not a little to the horrid workings of his teeming fancy At length something tapped him upon the shoulder when turning round in an agony of fear he saw as plain as ever he did any thing in his life John Swash staring him in the face What at this moment were the poor taylors sensations He squeaked kicked plunged without being able to take his eyes from this dreadful object till presently his sight failed him his muscles were all relaxed and he measured his length on the ground
A few tweaks by the nose and some cold water brought him a little to himself when he found John and another servant lifting him up This circumstance did not a little facilitate his recovery The moment he got the use of his speech he cried out
For the love of God dear christian gentlemen speak to me Oh Lord is he gone Did you see him Oh dear dear dear dear—there he comes again Hold me fast—dont let him fly away with me
John and his fellow servant had some difficulty to comply with his request he struggled so hard for fear gave him the strength of a giant
The spectre approaching the taylors fear or rather horror was beyond description
There cried he Dont you see it
See what said John I see nothing but the trees and the stars do you Thomas
Not I said Thomas
Come come sir doo ey goo to bed—yow han not a slept to night When the woine a be got out of your head yowl be in your right wits like a sober parson
The ghost now began to speak
Hush hush cried the taylor
Oh Lord have mercy upon me save and deliver me It speaks Oh John Swash John Swash how have I offended thee
Oh miserable taylor listen to me said the ghost
I will John indeed said the poor terror-struck wretch
and now the ghost went on
For the lucre of gain thou didst try to hang me though well thou knowest I never did thee harm but I have escaped thy malice for rather than bring disgrace upon my poor wife and family I made away with myself Now if thou wishest to sleep peaceably in thy bed make a full confession of thy wickedness to Sir Sidney Roebuck and through him restore to my unhappy family that money which thou hast at different times frightened me out of Remember and let not my angry spirit visit thee a second time
So saying the ghost disappeared
Lord have mercy save deliver and forgive my sins said the taylor
What dye toak about said Thomas
Pardon a poor wretched miserable sinner exclaimed the taylor
Come come said John it will be time enough to say your prayers when you are up in your room
How can you be so blasphemous said the taylor did not you hear what he said
Who Who cried John
Why the mans out of his wits—
Who exclaimed Snip why poor John Swash I have killed I have murdered him and his blood will be on my hands
Odds wounds cried Thomas these be odd sort of speeches I do not wonder yow be troubled in mind if yow a done such wicked things as these—but coom yow be only a sleep and a dreaming
In short the trembling taylor was at last conveyed to his room where he lay sweating and shivering and almost suffocated under the clothes till day-light
He now got up and saying his prayers longer and louder than ever he had done in his life he began though still in bodily fear to consider how he should prevent a second visit from the ghost As however the family was not yet stirring and he thought he had made pretty sufficient disturbance in it already he returned once more to bed where having undergone so much mental and corporeal fatigue he fell into a sound sleep which probably saved him from a severe fit of sickness
The reader has seen that the windows had been purposely blocked up on the first night on the out side to cheat the taylor through the whole of that day into a belief that it was not yet light by which means the trial of Swash came on and he was acquitted for want of evidence for as to the confederate Figgins had seen and so completely intimidated him with threatening to lay a detainer against him on another score that he purposely prevaricated on the trial and the whole business was dismissed as frivolous and vexatious The noise which the taylor heard when he was in the garden and which his fears had so greatly magnified was nothing more than the taking down the blinds which as I have said on the outside were affixed to the windows—But the ghost was no other than the individual John Swash who had been released in the afternoon and properly tutored for the purpose
The taylor at the proper time was summoned to breakfast in the parlour where he was kindly received by Mr Figgins and Charles as well as the poet and the musician—the painter being gone to take a walk They informed him they were extremely sorry to hear he had been so ill in the night and the poet pretending to know something of physic felt his pulse which having done very gravely he declared that the gentleman was not so ill in body as that he was troubled with thick-coming fancies that disturbed his rest
Thats very true sir said the taylor you have found out my disorder at once
Well but cant you cure him of that said Figgins
No answered the poet gravely in that case the patient must administer unto himself
Thank you sir said the taylor it is very true—he must indeed—and so I will if it shall please God before I am many hours older
You see you see said the poet I know all the symptoms of this disorder You are very hungry sir are you not
Yes sir said the taylor I dare say I could eat a shoulder of mutton and look round me
A bad symptom sir said the poet
Pooh pooh cried Charles I will never believe that a hungry sick man is in much danger Come John let us have the breakfast the gentleman will be too late for the trial
Then addressing himself to the taylor
When do you expect it to come on sir I hope you will convict the rascal for really times are come to such a pass that an honest man cannot keep his property in safety
The taylors countenance underwent several alterations and he faultered out
why sir I dont think it will come on at all
Here John came in with a smoaking plate of toast
Zounds let us fall to
said Charles
Come sir help yourself
The taylor began to put a piece to his mouth when in came the painter
Your servant said Figgins where have you been this morning—
Faith said Musquito I have been to see a very unpleasant spectacle I assure you A poor fellow one Swash who was to have been tried this morning for sheep-stealing poisoned himself last night in his cell and through the interest of Sir Sidney Roebuck the coroners verdict was returned lunacy and they are now carrying the body to his wife and children
Here the tea and toast dropt out of the taylors hand and he entreated for the love of God that he might be conducted to that very Sir Sidney Roebuck for he could not eat nor sleep before he disburthened his conscience of something that lay very heavy on it
Every one affected extraordinary surprise at this declaration after which Mr Figgins said
Sir I am a clergyman and if I can do you any service by hearing your confession and giving you salutary advice I will do it with pleasure
To which the terrified taylor—looking about him—said
No sir that wont do I am afraid he will appear again if I tell it to any body but Sir Sidney—
Appear said Charles Who Who will appear
The ghost sir the ghost said the taylor John Swashs ghost
A gentleman now desired to speak with Mr Figgins who being ushered in proved to be Sir Sidney
The moment the taylor saw him he fell upon his knees and cried out
Oh dear sir forgive me—
Forgive you said Sir Sidney why who are you
Sir said he I am the taylor the wicked taylor that tried to hang John Swash
The baronet was then informed of all the ghost enjoined Snip and at length on his earnest entreaty went apart with him to make an ample confession This indeed amounted to nothing criminal in the taylor except the extortion of the money but it laid up such a body of evidence against the emigrants from Little Hockley as the baronet had no doubt would put a stop to their nefarious attempts for the future
The taylors confession being signed and sworn to he was permitted to eat a voracious breakfast with John for nothing after this could prevail on him to come into the parlour
A large cavalcade now appeared in the road which poor Snip as well as every body else knew to be the judges who were leaving Warwick to open the assizes at Worcester
The taylor though no great conjuror saw plainly he had been tricked He now neither wondered at his restlessness nor his hunger and lest he should any longer remain in doubt John Swash himself—who softly entered the kitchen—tapped him upon the shoulder once more saying
Master Cabbage you have twice taken me for a ghost beware of the third time
The taylor received a very wholesome admonition from Sir Sidney who explained to him in very pathetic terms the cruelty and wanton maliciousness of disturbing the quiet of a man and his family who he said were objects of great compassion as well as praise for there were very few instances of those who had so given themselves up to bad example as to have been guilty of every wickedness and depravity and afterwards desirous of returning from their vicious courses He said there was no encouragement to which such objects were not entitled How reprehensible then was it in those who waited for the moment when such should return to virtue and in consequence of their honest industry become in tolerable circumstances to seek for opportunities to distress and harrass them and so prevent the happy effects of their laudable and honest endeavours
As for the taylor he told him he was well convinced he had been set on by others and as he had now made a candid and fair confession relative to all those dark conspiracies which he plainly saw were levelled against these poor repentant sinners if he would go on a little further and join with him in detecting this knot of villains he might rely upon his favour and he would enjoy a much higher satisfaction—that of discharging his duty as an honest man
The taylor was suffered to depart after faithfully promising all that had been enjoined him and Sir Sidney was for the first time let into the whole of the mystery by which the taylor had been prevented from appearing at the trial for it must be understood that Sir Sidney knew the taylor was to be kept away but he did not know in what manner
CHAPTER VIII
A NEW CURE FOR AN AMOROUS FEVER
THE housekeeping of Mr Figgins near Warwick being now broken up Charles and his friend returned to Hazard house and Musquito Ego and Toogood to Roebuck hall
Charles had noticed that Musquito in consequence of his satiric vein had conceived himself a kind of superior to his two companions for whenever it came up in conversation that they had been ridiculed in the business of the ghost he took care sagaciously to hint that no one dared play him such a trick
Our hero was therefore determined to leave him no room for exultation especially as by the mode through which he intended to shew him off as well as the rest he should do even a more meritorious act than he had done in saving Emma from the persecutions of the poet and the musician This method of studying mischief only by way of inflicting merited punishment was a species of amusement in which it has been seen our hero delighted It certainly was highly praiseworthy in one sense for it turned every thing off with a laugh only against the offender whereas had it been shaped into a complaint and preferred against him to Sir Sidney it might have endangered the hopes which he built on his patronage
John Swash had a daughter who must have had an uncommon mind for her situation in life for from her earliest infancy she was remarked to have had a detestation to that vice which surrounded her She profitted by avoiding bad examples as much as others by imitating good ones In short—which is the strongest proof that can be given of the excellence of her heart and the incorruptibility of her honour she at eighteen was as spotless a character at Little Hockley as the most innocent inhabitant of her age and sex could be at Castlewick
The painter had long laid siege to this young creature who had all that beauty which regular features rosy health and a perfect symmetry of form can give He drew her likeness and took care it should be a flattering one He took a sketch of the mill and made it a present to Swash whose professional pride was thus tickled He painted a favourite tortoiseshell cat for the mother and in a variety of other instances made his talents subservient to his wishes but in particular he vaunted that he had been the principal instrument in detaining the taylor from appearing at the trial
I know not if the girls gratitude on the side of her duty pleaded in his favour or whether nature began to whisper to her that good as she was love—as somebody has expressed it—is the sovereign end of our being but certainly she began to listen to the painters conversation with pleasure and as she had never in her life been controlled scrupled not to walk with him in an evening She soon however repented of her complaisance and was almost fatally convinced on what terms these opportunities were requested She resented his insolence which was manuel as well as verbal and without ceremony informed her mother of all that had passed who good woman I am sorry to say it did not make such forcible objections to it as the daughter did To say the truth she had a large family and looked upon her daughters as much in the light of traffic as her barley meal In short won by a handsome sum a promise of painting her picture in the attitude of milking a favourite cow and a half anker of genuine nantz—with shame I write it—after but little hesitation she agreed to this method of providing for her girl as she called it
This good woman in her youth had been tolerably handsome herself Master Flush had been heard to intimate that he fancied the governor—meaning Standfast—had taken care to provide a birth in heaven for Master Swash in the month of April but I am afraid nobody had so strong a claim to that favour as Lord Hazard
Charles had eyed this girl with pleasure but would not for the universe have given way to the shadow of an impulse to her dishonour And here it may not be amiss to beg the reader will stop with me and admire how greatly to our own advantage we take resolutions which are in favour of virtue for it is within possibility that had our hero given way to an inclination natural enough for a youth of warm blood to entertain and I hope full as natural if there were any thing like honour in his disposition to conquer—hear it ye seducers of virtue Ye merciless triumphant despoilers of innocence who are cruel because you have power—insolent because victorious—hear it and reflect with horror on the miseries that to often result from your vices—he might have contaminated a sister
From so deplorable a crime however unintentional did Charles by his perseverance in his honourable resolutions very probably escape for he by his frequent chat with this girl had taught her bosom to glow with tenderness but having put the curb as we have seen upon his wishes and ceased to be particular from the moment he was apprehensive of danger—during which interval the painter stept in—she found some pleasure which the reader may be assured is not unnatural in listening to language of the same kind from another even though it was not so eloquently worded or so gracefully delivered
As Charles withdrew his attention from this girl upon a ground for which she loved him still more—for he made no scruple of confessing the truth—the poor girl having been repulsed by her mother as we have seen or rather encouraged to make her fortune according to the old gentlewoman by that which according to any body else would have been her ruin was walking solitary and unhappy by the side of her fathers mill-stream when Figgins and our hero passed by Charles saw the pearly tear standing on her cheek and very good naturedly enquired the cause After a little reluctance she informed him and concluded her artlessly pathetic story with saying
Indeed it is a sad thing when a poor girls mother bids her to be wicked but I wont be wicked if I am ever so undutiful I wont
Both Charles and Figgins commended her laudable resolution and now occurred an admirable opportunity of punishing the painter in his own way He immediately told the girl of his intention to forward which she was desired to acquaint her mother that she would be a good girl and behave civil to the gentleman and when he came she should make him an appointment in the dusk of the evening in the bed chamber that he would let her father privately into the secret who should in concert with them so revenge himself upon her audacious lover as to leave him very little relish for such amusement in future
The girl was charmed to find her cause taken up so warmly by our hero for she knew let what would happen the painter must not dare to complain
The assignation was made and Swash apprized of the whole business The painter as may naturally be supposed attended punctually and the husband being as it was imagined safe at the ale house the amorous Appelles was conducted to the young ladys bed chamber by her accommodating mamma and desired to go to bed where he should be made as happy as he could wish
He had not lain long in this situation before he heard a foot upon the stairs when immediately his heart beat high his fancy anticipated the expected pleasure and all his senses were in an alarm but however all these were nothing to the alarm that presently followed In rushed—at least his fears made him believe so—half a dozen myrmidons pop half a dozen times went half a dozen pistols the first of which was a sufficient intimation that the salute had very little of love in it Indeed he wondered how it came that he was not a dead man for his fears had wounded him in twenty places
The very first of these hints he took and darting out of the foot of the bed he presently cleared the landing place and gained the bottom of the stairs by which time he received a few more compliments of the same kind These however though they were unnecessary to refresh his memory hastened his departure which he took without paying the smallest compliment to any of the family but rushing out at the street door made his way across a paddock which led to the road his pursuers still popping at such a rate that he verily believed he was flying from a whole platoon
Being come to a bank he collected his whole might to jump over the hedge into the road but the distance being greater than he imagined he plunged with all his force naked as he was into a bramble bush which clinging in a hundred places to his shirt and in as many to his flesh pinned him down so firmly that he was obliged to make several excruciating efforts to free himself He did so however at last but finding himself surrounded with enemies who were still popping at him he doubled as artfully as any Jack hare and was followed as closely with this difference that the game opened instead of the pack for he yelped howled swore ejaculated cursed and prayed in such a strange collection of hysterical tones that the musician who was then present had as much reason to be enraged as Hogarths for all the complicated din there described seemed to be centured in one person
This discordance however did not last long for trying to cross the mill stream by a bridge which to be sure had been laid down an hour before but was now drawn up poor Musquito came souse over head and ears into the water which being in that part pretty deep would have cooled him for intriguing and every thing else in this world had not a large fishing net been previously placed to receive him
The net was immediately drawn up which with all the haste they could make however was not effected before the poor painter had totally lost his senses
He was now put into a shell and the church being near carried to the bone house where being held up by the heels a quantity of water ran out of his mouth and he presently exhibited signs of life The moment this event took place they hurried off with the lanthorn—the only light they had—and the sexton who being a friend to the miller connived at the trick immediately returned with his mattock and shovel on his shoulder
There said he as if to himself that jobs done
Oh d d d d dear cried the painter
It is odd there should be nobody to own the man cried the sexton putting down his things
B b b oh—ah—oh— cried the painter
I have made him a good grave however cried the sexton and as soon as the coroners quest has sat upon him—
The painter now mustered strength enough to sit up and cried
Oh d d d d dear—f f f f friend—
Lord whats that said the sexton
Oh f f f f for the love of God help me cried Musquito
Why lookee now said the sexton heres my man come to life Lie down now doey lie down I ha been just making your grave
Oh Lord exclaimed the painter my g g g g grave
Ay ay nobody will own you you see and so we shall bury you to-morrow morning
Bury me cried the painter who had by this time got out of the shell Oh Christ where am I brought to—then looking round him—Oh dear friend have pity upon me
Odds wounds cried the sexton dont come nigh me I never could abide a dead body in my life unless in the way of business and when it was screwed up as a body may say so dont come nigh me
The painter told him he was alive the sexton said he was a damned liar and took up the lanthorn to be gone the painter followed the sexton holhowing out
the devil take the hindmost
At length turning round a corner of the church he blew out the candle slipt away and the painter found himself alone sore from head to foot wet and naked in the middle of a church yard above two miles from Sir Sidneys at half an hour past ten oclock at night
In this condition he posted to the alehouse where he intended to have trumped up a story of his being robbed but his old friend the sexton being the first man he saw in the room he only desired the use of some clothes for which he said he would satisfy them handsomely
The man of the house agreed to accommodate him and fetched some things for that purpose which Musquito put on before the fire for the landlady was gone to bed In the mean time the guests were not sparing of their jokes
Bless me said one the gentleman has been sadly mauled with zummet He looks as if he had tumbled into a hornets nest
Icod said another I think its more like being scratched with cats
Very loikely said another two legged cats may hap
Lord love you cried the sexton you noas nothing about it The gentleman was tooked up in the mill-dam They mistooken for a vish—Dam maw I thoughten the biggest Jack I ever sawed And so as I was a telling you when the gentleman coomed in we took un to the boane-house Adds waunds measter you do ought to give maw zummet to drink your health after making your grave
The painter did not reply a single word to all this wit but having hurried on the landlords clothes and said he would return them in the morning and satisfy him for his trouble he sneaked to Sir Sidneys and skulked up stairs to bed
Charles and Figgins came in the morning to breakfast Every body was very inquisitive to know how it happened that the painter had not supped at home One said significantly he was perhaps better engaged another that whatever his amusement was he hoped it was to his liking In short the poor painter was handsomely played off At last it came to Sir Sidneys turn who said honest Swash had been with him that morning about an affair something in the style of the soldier and the king of France—the soldier craved pardon for having thrown a mans hat out of window and having obtained it said he had thrown his head out too
Here Sir Sidney related the whole business of the preceding evening as indeed he had heard it from Charles not from Swash He concealed his knowledge of the gallant who he said was rightly served and he only wished the next time the gentleman whoever he was took it into his head to corrupt innocence and destroy domestic peace he would never after having done so presume to come into his presence He concluded with reprobating the conduct of the mother and heartily recommending the girl to Lady Roebucks notice who declared as Emma was in want of an assistant she should be immediately placed about the person of Annette
CHAPTER IX
IN WHICH THE READER IS ATTACKED ON THE SIDE OF HIS SENSIBILITY
IT never for a single moment occurred to Charles that he had wrought an event most wonderfully in his own favour by thus punishing the painter for Jude—so was the millers daughter called—rang the changes in his praise so continually that as her voice was the voice of nature and her sentiments strong genuine gratitude his cause could not even in Emma have had half so powerful an advocate nay with Emma herself—for though she was well enough pleased that the youth had conceived favourable thoughts of her though she admired the ready willingness with which he had corrected his error yet there was with her a distinct difference in the two cases As to herself she was a host alone she defied temptation and to such a youth as Charles she was rather pleased than concerned that she had had an opportunity of shewing upon what erroneous ground he began his career and what certain misery would be the consequence of his persuting in indiscriminate pursuits in which he might be assured though he would often dupe others he would oftener be duped himself
Emma represented to him that the sensations of a tender and susceptible heart which had given a single pang to suffering virtue must be intolerable and therefore conjured him to cease from a conduct which was foolish as well as wicked impolitic as well as unworthy for it was a barter of virtue for infamy transient pleasure for lasting pain and however consonant to the boisterous and turbulent passions of youth would throughout his life be overshadowed by a cloud of wretchedness which the splendour of rank and distinction would vainly struggle to dissipate
To say the truth this incident had touched Emma in the right key for if she gave Charles credit for his delicate and honourable treatment of Jude how much then was due to her admonitions which produced it
If Emma had a weak side certainly this was it She was perfectly a schemer on the side of virtue and thought the passions might be bottled up like the winds of Aeolus forgetting that there never wants curious and turbulent spirits to let them out not only to excite fresh dangers but make the case worse by leaving no remedy
Nevertheless nothing could be purer than poor Emmas intentions which though they were not always infallible hit nine times out of ten as she wished they should Here it was impossible they should miss Standfast indeed had he so far condescended would have at pleasure changed the form of every one of them and spight of Emmas penetration have shewn them even to her so deformed that she should scarcely have known them for her own
This gentleman however seems to be meditating at a distance and as the course is left free for youth sweetness good nature and ingenuity to pay their open court to beauty modesty and delicate sensibility no wonder if sanctioned by parents strongly supported by irresistible advocates and their mutual wishes being in their essence eminently congenial a strong and one would think indissoluble compact must naturally be formed between Charles and Annette
To speak plain which I as well as Emma think the best way so many were the desirable ends an union between this amiable couple promised to aecomplish that had it not been for their youth—though probably they would not have found that an objection—neither themselves the fathers and mothers connections and dependants the two villages of Castlewick and Little Hockley—for Little Hockley was really now rising into same in spight of Mrs Swash and her unworthy propensities for which between the reader and I she got well thrashed by her husband—not one of these I say but would have blessed the day which united this lovely pair and what to some of them would not have been an unwelcome object have produced an extraordinary grand feast
But whether fortune thought with Emma that virtues and passions are given us to be exercised and controlled or whether the mind like the constitution is soberer in its age for having been taken down in its youth I shall not pretend to decide here—certain it is that the blind and varying goddess did not altogether take part with the friends of our hero and heroine the reason why and the manner how she thought proper to dissent from this otherwise unanimous opinion will hereafter be gradually developed In the mean time I am really concerned that just when we find Charles and Annette in the full enjoyment of their friends admiration and that of one another I should be under the unpleasant necessity of throwing as complete a damp over all their spirits—such a scene of light and darkness is this life—as I had before presented to them of joy and exultation
I am sure the very name of poor Lady Hazard will anticipate every word of the sad tale it is my unwilling duty to relate This amiable lady this lovely this fatal sacrifice to complicated villany whose fall was doomed to tear the heart of him who in early life had departed from the paths of honour This charming victim who it should seem by an error of fate received the blow that was meant for her lord—But it was no error it is blindness to suppose fate can err he was to live that in the expiation of his original guilt his pangs might torture him with accumulated keenness—
Sweet Lady Hazard who had seemed to decline with the summer had been for some weeks evidently hastening to her dissolution when at length the solemn sentence of the physicians precluded all hope Indeed she felt that a few hours would put a period to her sufferings and desired with calm resignation that she might for the last time see her friends about her
This affecting request was soon complied with for Lady Roebuck had been almost continually with her from the moment she was in actual danger and though our hero and his companions had at different opportunities employed their time as we have seen yet the most thoughtless of them would at any moment have flown to have contributed in the slightest degree to her ease or comfort In fact she was gliding out of the world by such imperceptible degrees that as she supported her melancholy situation with wonderful fortitude there had ever been till very lately some slight hope of her recovery
Lord Hazard had some time by her own particular desire been left alone with his lady Before however I relate what passed at this affecting interview that I may not improperly interrupt the readers banquet of grief—which by some is thought to be a very delicious luxury—I shall notice in order if possible to heighten the loveliness of Lady Hazard and the wretchedness of her Lord that owing to some expressions which fell from the surgeon during the operation at the John of Gaunt—which I have described as particular as was necessary or delicate—she became acquainted with that secret which seems to be set up as a beacon in this history to warn the reader that a very small deviation from prudence may plunge a family into irretrievable misery
The interview between Lord and Lady Hazard was of that affecting kind that at once excites pity and terror It was one of those moments when the tongue denies relief to the heart when nature would sink but for the assistance of madness and when the pressure of calamity numbs the keenness of its torture
Lord Hazard overwhelmed with the recollection of his unworthiness and loaded with the self-reproaching consciousness of his guilt lay in a torpid stupor His angel wife though every sigh hastened her departure pitied his pangs and sorrowed for his sufferings He burning to disclose what shame forbid him to utter and she dreading a horrid tale she had long and silently anticipated
In this state—that hand of death extended over her brow which he would have given the world to have been directed to his—no merciful tear to relieve his swolen heart he must have expired with excessive sensibility had not a few inarticulate sounds accompanied by a piteous sigh burst from his tortured bosom
Be calm my sweet love cried Lady Hazard
Calm returned he
—her celestial voice penetrating his torn heart and the tears gushing in torrents from his eyes—
Yes calm as the pitiless butcher that kills the innocent lamb When thy spotless soul shall look down with just horror and kind commiseration on thy polluted husband and thy cruel murderer then tell me to be calm Infuse thy incomparable innocence into my culpable heart inspire me with virtue and teach me to be happy See Oh heavenly God—she hears me with sorrow but not with astonishment She knew it—tis plain she knew it—and my foul crimes have like the influence of a malignant poison slowly consumed her life Pity pardon immaculate angel—But my thoughtless frenzy is too much for her tender frame How are you my love She answers wildly
—And so indeed she did Lord Hazards violence had thrown her into a delirium in which she remained a few minutes and then expired
The incoherent expressions she uttered during this melancholy interval sufficiently confimed Lord Hazard that his lady was but too well acquainted with the fatal secret and lest he should not be wretched enough at her loss he had now the additional reflection that his crime had first sapped the foundation of her peace and afterwards gradually destroyed her life Regardless however of any discovery or its consequences he summoned every possible assistance to her aid but no syllable that escaped Lady Hazard reached any ear except that Charles who first entered the room heard his mother fervently exclaim which were the last words she uttered
If any blessings were in store for me of which I have been untimely deprived shower them merciful heaven upon the head of my dear boy
CHAPTER X
NEW MATTER
Having so completely thrown the two families in the country into the vapours as to make it impossible they should play any of their whimsical tricks in our absence the reader and I will take a look at Mr Standfast and his associates and as much as any thing because it is now high time that we should rescue that gentlemans fame from such an opprobrious stain as that of having compassed the death of Lady Hazard and brought about that scene of distress described in the last chapter solely for the purpose of doing mischief
I am ready to grant that no man upon earth had more satisfaction in contemplating the wretchedness which was produced by any one of his contrivances but then I do insist that it was not so much for the pleasure of the thing as the collateral consideration and I sincerely believe ill as I think of him that could he have had the smallest chance of doubling his advantage be it in profit or pleasure by sacrificing his whole party he would not have made a single scruple
But to argue this matter fairly What had Mr Standfast gained by heaping all this complicated mischief on the head of his friend and benefactor but an addition to the salary which he had honestly earned by being tutor to Charles Why nothing literally to be sure as to himself As to whom then This is an article that remains to be accounted for Again if Mr Standfast on his own account received no other satisfaction—which surely was a small reward for such eminent villany—what other motive stimulated him Revenge—Revenge Yes—and now let me get rid of these two articles And first as to whom he seemed to be working for
Know then reader that Mr Standfast the consummately artful Mr Standfast whose superior talents in the craft of inflicting unmerited calamity none ever attained whose truly diabolical spirit never conceived mischief complete unless the shaft with which it wounded struck at virtue who could cajole and cozen all the world and dupe every one else was himself a dupe to—Mrs OShocknesy
Here is the collateral consideration but whence the revenge From the same quarter Mr Standfast who held all women as his slaves who treated serious reasonable honourable love as a banter who mocked at the very idea of a solemn and sacred obligation to a woman this very Mr Standfast—pity him oh pity him villain as he is—was a slave to Mrs OShocknesy Hence his revenge He was her first love was the friend of him who killed her husband in a duel she had a child by him before she saw Lord Hazard and would have married him but that his lordship stept in and carried her—nay let me whisper to the reader that it was not impossible but Zekiel was his son
A number of doubts which the reader had before formed are now dissipated nor will it be necessary to go again over the minutiae of Mr Standfasts conduct which was dictated by her though carried into effect by him and as she dared join ostensible acts to his covert ones what wonder if the unsuspecting virtue of Lord Hazard was surprised
Her views and her ambition were obvious—Lady Hazard was to be put out of the way by a diabolical contrivance which had it been avowed could have fastened nothing on its perpetrators His lordship would naturally be inconsolable for her loss and who knew if he would survive it when he came to consider that it originated in his guilt Should this imaginary blessing be realized her son would come into possession of the title and estate if not she would at least have the triumphant consolation that she had imbittered his future felicity
This conduct was natural and common infamous as it was But how shall we account for that of her paramour who could not fond soul rest in the country absent from her he loved Charles as to Miss Figgins was a stoic to him The lady had promised on the death of Lady Hazard to honour him with her hand and instead of going to receive the last benediction of an expiring uncle his business in town was to keep from expiring the valuable love of the amiable Mrs OShocknesy
Thus while friendship obligation and all other ties that naturally induce gratitude only stimulated Mr Standfast to every atrocious and rascally measure that could sap the foundation and lay a train for the destruction of that love and harmony that were exemplary in the family of his patron and benefactor The mere whim and caprice of a woman whom he knew to be worthless and completely the reverse of every thing for which she could expect admiration made him—expert as he was at every thing artful proof as he was against every thing but self—undertake the most wicked as well as the most silly things in nature Here is a Hercules not contented with wielding the club—not quite so worthily by the bye—he buckles to the distaff
It will be unnecessary for me to mention that Figgins was sent for and fixed with Charles by Mr Standfasts participation nor will it very probably have escaped the readers sagacity that the whole affair of Miss Figgins who had not been with child was nothing more than to hold out a pretended secret over the head of that young gentleman for both Standfast and Figgins well knew that there is not a stronger hold of a grateful and generous heart than the knowledge of obligation and this is the sort of credulity I have described as a part of our heros composition which throughout his life induced him to be thankful to others for lending him imaginary benefits that they might receive from him real ones
But why should Charles be devoted to the same ruin with others He could not possibly hinder any one of their schemes He had nothing that could give them the smallest uneasiness Was it then nothing to be the darling child the hopeful cherished favourite while Mrs OShocknesy and her son were turned into the world the sport of malicious tongues and the vestiges of fallen greatness Charles—though were the records of the human heart searched for every thing good and great that ever made up an amiable character the same marks of worth would be found in his—Charles must be traduced must be vilified it was necessary it was material he must be sunk that his elder brother might rise Besides Mr Standfast had a husband in his eye for Annette a better husband since who can deny but a rich sensible thinking youth as one will appear answers that description more perfectly than a poor vicious dissipated inconstant wretch as will be the character of the other
Reader it was not Zekiel that our friend Standfast had found out for Annette I know not if such an attempt would not have been a touch even above his art but however that young gentleman will probably shew by and by that he would chuse to be consulted before any material step should be taken that concerned him
Master Zekiel had at the time I am speaking pretty decided opinions and one of them was to appear however he might really be satisfied with all his mother and Mr Standfast should determine unless they should ask him to sign any paper which he was fully resolved never to do
As the reader has not yet heard the upshot of the business relative to those letters wherein an application was made for the grant of the estate in Warwickshire I may as well inform him here that Sir Sidneys application rendered that of Mrs OShocknesy and her son fruitless therefore through Standfasts advice an addition was made to the annual stipend of the son who immediately left Eaton and went to France with Snaffle for his companion and Flush for his valet while Dogbolt who had long ago dropt his title being a handsome fellow occasionally comforted Mrs OShocknesy when Mr Standfast who as yet dared not see her except by stealth was out of the way
Mr Kiddy had taken good care to make himself particularly useful to Zekiel who swore there was so much fun and gig about the rum dog that he would rather have him for a companion than all the black-jacket codgers in England
Whether Kiddy had any latent meaning in the singular pains he took to ingratiate himself with his young master I will not here enquire but certainly Standfast one day told him to take care how he came on to which Kiddy archly replied
Oh as for that master governor dont you go for to be uneasy honour you know among thieves
Thus have I shewn when all things are considered that Standfast was the worst actor in his own farce Nay I know not upon all great occasions whether to the subordinate objects the whole praise is not attributable Trim says while he is mustering his tattered troop fifty thousand such ragged rascals as these would make an ALEXANDER and who can deny but the taylor and the mantua-maker tell truth when they say that the splendour of the birth night is owing to them
CHAPTER XI
A RECEIPT FOR BUILDING BY BEGINNING AT THE SUPERSTRUCTURE
FOR want of leisure or perhaps inclination or for some other wise reason no less cogent I did not mention to the reader that at the last grand feast a young stranger appeared and indeed attracted a great deal of notice He was then just arrived from Madeira and brought letters to Sir Sidney from a merchant there with whom the baronet dealt for wines and transacted other business Coming so opportunely he was invited to the feast and cut as I have said no inconsiderable figure
Charles took great pleasure in accommodating this gentleman whose name was Gloss studying his ease and convenience while he remained in Warwickshire He requested the pleasure of corresponding with him and begged his intimate friendship when he should return to England with a view of settling which he talked of doing after he should have taken a trip to the Cape of Good Hope where his father had died immensely rich on his return from India
The winter had now began so to perriwig the trees as somebody has called it—by the way somebody and nobody are very useful figures in rhetoric—that the semicircle of evergreens before Sir Sidneys saloon with the clusters near it looked like a vegetable court of judges and counsellors in powdered ties and full-bottoms
This hint and a call of the house of commons—for Sir Sidney had stayed in the country beyond his usual time roused the baronet and made him begin to think of putting on his boots Yet not even his duty dearly as he loved it could induce him to stir a step without Lord Hazard who was become what SHAKESPEARE says of life
a walking shadow
Lord Hazard looked upon himself as the executioner of his wife and though his grief was inward yet it did not escape such vigilant friendship as Sir Sidneys His lordship declared he would devote himself to retirement His friends however at length prevailed and to make the satisfaction complete and universal Annette was for the first time to see London accompanied by Emma
It was the continual study of every one to make Lord Hazards time pass agreeably in which pleasurable task Mr Standfast now assisted whose presence his lordship confessed contributed greatly to relieve his care though heaven knows he had no such intention for his visits were for no other purpose than to warn him of certain snares which Mrs OShocknesy was not preparing for him in order if possible to entangle him in others that she was
About Christmas arrived Charless friend Gloss from the Cape of Good Hope where he had he said settled his affairs greatly to his satisfaction—He brought answers to some letters with which Sir Sidney entrusted him for Madeira
As Mr Gloss will hereafter cut no inconsiderable figure in this history it may not be improper to give some account of him He was the son of a clergyman who probably knowing that the advancement in the learned professions was a thing that depended less upon merit than interest had bred him up to trade not sparing however to give him a complete education which he very properly thought could do him no harm in any situation
One thing however was very romantic in this scheme All these bricks were to be made without straw for the old gentleman either could not or would not give his son a shilling towards laying a foundation for that fortune he was nevertheless sure he would one day or other make But having added the living languages to the dead ones and procured a recommendation for him to a countinghouse at Lisbon they parted the father furnishing him with some excellent rules for the regulation of his future conduct and forbidding him to draw for any thing but advice
The young gentlemans temper happened luckily to fall in with his fathers He undertook if he were eligibly set out to make his fortune His maxims were from early youth that if a man chose to fix his eye upon a spot let it be ever so out of his present reach or surrounded by ever such difficulties through perseverance it might be come at In little he had proved this doctrine to be founded for he never in his life possessed in his own right a single sixpence and yet he had cut a figure with the best
It is curious to remark that though no man upon earth knew better the value of substance than Mr Gloss yet he seem constantly to live upon shadow The appearance and not the thing itself seemed to be what he most delighted in He so completely turned round all his employers in their own business that the tide of their fortune soon ran in a larger channel and they were astonished at the riches which originated from plans of his advising They however little considered what a yoke they were forming for themselves for it was not long before the young gentleman stipulated for a participation of their profits in consequence of which he took the earliest opportunity to involve the affairs of the partnership and was the only one able to save any thing from the wreck of a bankruptcy in which the whole concern was soon involved
After this stroke he went to Madeira where he drew a picture of the folly of his partners and shewed very clearly—for it is certainly true that people are to be reasoned into as well as out of any thing—how unwisely they had acted and how foolishly he had thrown away his time
Being through a house with which he had been connected very soon taken in an active partner for a slight share of the profits and with liberty to trade privately on his own account he entered into the spirit of the Madeira trade in such a style as astonished every merchant on the island He had the address to tie the Dunkirk dealers down to give him and his connections a preference in brandies provided they dealt to such an amount in consequence of which he soon had it in his power to stagnate the Dunkirk trade in Madeira by being able to undersell the brandy merchants themselves who eager to catch at the bait he held out for them had supplied him largely little suspecting he would hold back what he had bought with a view of forestalling their next market
I give this as one among a variety of instances in which he saw further into peoples affairs than they did themselves By this means he had resources for them which they never dreamt of and of course was able to stipulate for better terms for himself
In the mean time it was one would think this mans pride never to have a shilling he could call his own Nothing was expensive enough for him and when it was his turn to treat at Bachelors-hall—a place at Madeira built by the unmarried men and remarkable for hospitality—it was in a style that astonished every body for his taste was equal to his ingenuity
At length Madeira became too barren a spot for the fecundity of his genius He left it after giving it many real advantages and was universally regretted as a man wonderfully calculated for business and yet a most agreeable companion
He got a considerable sum for his concern in the house he left which he took care in a few months to get rid of in England
The reader remembers that this gentleman brought letters from his connections in Madeira to Sir Sidney These were of course greatly in his favour Indeed the baronet was very well disposed to shew him any kindness but it was among the maxims of Mr Gloss never to make use of a friend except to carry a material point and a man must be very shallow indeed if he could not pretty well guess beforehand whether that point could be carried
The plan upon which this young gentleman proceeded was very simple but it required consummate talents It was nothing more than to administer to every mans foibles and reprobate his vices It is imppossible to describe how a man is infallibly taken hold of by a conduct of this kind Very few are uniformly good or uniformly wicked therefore all who are not have both follies and vices mixed with some good qualities Our follies are always agreeable to us but though all vices are the consequence of them we detest the vice itself while we hug the folly that may have caused it Close however as we may take folly to our hearts we never fail to be privately ashamed of ourselves for it nor to attribute in the face of the world our actions to any thing else rather than this hidden cause What power then must that man have over you who by encouraging you in your foibles not only has discovered this pleasurable deformity you are so studious to hide but by glossing it over contrives to make you believe it appears as agreeable to him as to yourself This man has your heart fully and wholly and there is nothing you can deny him
This was Mr Gloss who however he came by it had this art in the highest perfection and knew so well how and upon whom to play his game that he was ever sure of coming off winner
Nor are the talents which form this character of necessity required to be very brilliant though various and perspicuous They are of the minor kind a quickness of conception a close observation on men and manners some shrewdness and a good memory comprising them all to which indeed—but that would be a deduction in worthy matters— must be indispensibly added frontless impudence and a total want of feeling
Any man with these in his possession if he employ himself in nothing but this pursuit will arrive to as great perfection in the noble art of playing upon mankind as will raise him to that degree of consequence he may think proper
These qualifications stood with Mr Gloss in the place of Fortune and with these he turned that fickle ladys wheel as he thought proper
Will not the reader begin to feel uncomfortable when in conformity to that veracity which all historians should critically keep in view I am obliged to declare that this was the gentleman Mr Standfast had in his eye as a husband for Annette
Charles Figgins and Mr Gloss were inseperable The latter cut a prodigious figure He had an elegant chariot half a dozen footmen and might have been taken for a newly arrived nabob It was an extraordinary thing however that go where they would though he was sure to run up a most expensive reckoning he by some carelessness or other constantly left his purse at home so that he presently became indebted to Charles more than two hundred pounds in odds and ends of this kind
This passed off as eccentricity and as he had a most agreeable apparent indolence of mind which by the way was what Kiddy would have called a copy of his countenance he appeared to our hero the most delightful companion he had ever met with
It was agreed that Charles with Figgins as a companion should early in the spring set out to make a tour of Europe in which he ventured to express a very strong wish that Mr Gloss would accompany him
This however could not be That gentleman was in treaty for a borough which a member was expected every day to vacate in his favour Besides he had requested Sir Sidney to cheapen an estate for him in Warwickshire and he was cursedly afraid that a certain woman of condition that he said should be nameless—and so she well might for she was not in existence—would insist upon a kind of a half promise he had made and noose him which matter he said were it really serious he verily believed would drive him abroad for he did not think the possession of the finest and richest woman in the kingdom a compensation for the loss of any mans liberty of his figure and consequence
CHAPTER XII
CONSISTING OF ADVICE AND AN ADIEU TO ENGLAND
THE spring put an end to those town enjoyments which had employed the leisure hours of our hero and his connections and now Charles and his friend Figgins began to prepare for an excursion to those parts of the world where true politeness is thought to be native so heartily do Englishmen reprobate the manners of their own country though they so dearly love its principles
It was settled that our hero should go on to Italy by the borders of Flanders and not see Paris till on his return to England through the heart of France as it was thought by that means he would the better taste the pleasures of that capital
Charless heart was fully set on this tour and for several days it was the general topic of all the friends He received the good wishes and advice of all with great thankfulness Sir Sidney with the heartiest friendship entreated him not to engraft French manners upon an English cion He begged of him to hear see and consider to approve and adopt whatever mended the heart but to reject with contempt all that merely went to decorate the person He said a flattering exterior was a dangerous thing and there were sometimes more art and design under a feather than any graver decoration of the head He said the whole character of the French was comprehended in minutiae that this rendered them at first sight agreeable afterwards necessary and at length to credulous men endearing but to the penetrating trifling and tiresome
Sir Sidney said he would not wish for a better authority for pronouncing a man weak and ignorant than his having a strong attachment upon repeated trials to the French in general They were he said polite without good manners acquainted with every thing though perfect in nothing praying one moment and cheating the next holding you in their arms and laughing over your shoulder gay with design accommodating with arrogance apparently open but really hypocritical assuming with meanness In short he said their lives were a mixture of pride and servility self-consequence and adulation stateliness and cringing protestation and insincerity and though their sports were the sports of children their mischief was the mischief of monkies
Happy the man then sir said Charles who like you can sensibly discriminate between the extremes of this motley character and retain so much of it for his own use as shall make him wary in his dealings with the world without being dishonourable
I know not said Sir Sidney whether I deserve your compliment but this is the very effect I would wish the French manners to have upon you who however cautioned will I fear from the openness of your heart and your strong desire to find men what they ought to be take without examination that dross which the French so very easily contrive to pass for sterling As to Italy see every valuable picture statue and structure hear all that is excellent in music admire the country and come away lest exclusive of the danger to your own morals you are obliged to confess that the most beautiful and once the most glorious place in the world is now the most infamous
Lady Roebuck who truly regarded Charles as her son as much from inclination as from a promise made to Lady Hazard on her death bed gave him only general advice as to his youth and inexperience relying however on his strong good sense and that rectitude of heart which as we have already noticed was remarkable in so young a man She promised to keep Annette firmly to her sentiments of esteem for him and doubted not but his conduct would warrant all her exertions in the promotion of his happiness and finally that Annette improved at home and he abroad there could be no doubt of their making one of the most happy as well as elegant couples in the world
Emma warned him against the jays of France and the nightingales of Italy She said she foresaw that if his heart was not steel and adamant he would be ruined that she had read his mind thoroughly and plainly saw that the only vice he had in the world was want of deceit It was to be sure a strange declaration but it was very true That she should not wonder at any thing he became in the hands of the French and Italians for he was such pliable wax that any man with a plausible story the argument of which could be deduced from a good motive might shape him into any form She begged of him in particular to beware of holy hypocrites What she had read she told him of their cruelty and dissoluteness was yet worse if possible than all the gambols with which the forms of their facetious religion seemed to burlesque its author or rather the author of that which they daringly ventured to innovate and which involved a system of morality mild as mercy and benignant as his holy name who established it Above all she cautioned him against convents and an intercourse with those drones of society the inmates of them who from leisure to plan and inclination to execute were the perpetrators of every species of profligacy and mischief Her reading she said had induced her to believe that there were more than three hundred thousand cloystered clergy in France and a proportionable number of females that the wickedness the attrocious wickedness carried on within those walls which were supposed to immure saints was shockto humanity
Emma further observed that it could not be supposed that any thing like the licentious infamy of France and Italy could ever have been practised here because England had properly speaking never been the seat of that dangerous religion but let it be recollected in the reign of Henry the Eighth what barbarous what detestable vestiges of popish profligacy were discovered at the demolishing Netley abbey and many other convents—Subterraneous communications for nightly visits from friars to nuns and nuns to friars Hidden infants apparently murdered If then the plant which was here an exotic grew to such perfection how must it flourish in its native soil It was horrible to think of it
But added Emma if I may credit what I have read this most unholy irreverent indecent ridiculous religion is clearly where it exists a jest with all but the superstitious ignorant What is the mode of choosing a pope but a blasphemous imposition in which one would think to punish them for presumptuously daring to give out that their election is from heaven they once by inspiration no doubt as well as upon all other occasions chose a woman who betrayed her sex their shame and opened the eyes of every one who chose to see But
vive la bagatelle
in that as in every thing else soon got the better of good sense and sound reason and they went on electing popes the choice of heaven not however without taking a precaution lest heaven should have again deceived them
Emmas precautions were applauded by a burst of laughter and Charles entreated her to make herself perfectly easy giving her his word that he would take particular care that his small plantation of understanding should not be eaten up by these black locusts
Annette took an innocent but tender leave of her lover for Emma had ever encouraged her not to be ashamed of a truly virtuous passion Our hero felt himself greatly charmed at the distinction and exulted not a little at reflecting that after time and experience should have prepared him with manly and proper resolutions and given him riper qualities of mind and person the possession of so charming an object would be within his reach Many were their mutual protestations ardent yet innocent heartfelt yet reasonable At length they separated with a promise to write to each other and with vows of inviolable fidelity
One audience now only stood with Lord Hazard before the time when our hero was to depart This interview was without witness My lord took his son tenderly by the hand saying
My dear Charles lowered as I am by my grief wretched by calamity and disordered by both my merits are more than rewarded by having you for my son I never made you a stranger to my youthful excesses indeed it would perhaps be policy to paint them to you even in their strongest colours that you might shun the certain ruin that awaits such profligacy Your incomparable mother now no more was—I cannot think of it but my soul is in arms—given me to bless my repentant heart with comfort more than such a wretch deserved yet did I after the enjoyment of such bliss such unexampled delight dash the cup of happiness from my lips in the very moment that it held for me all the blessings of life in one delicious draught
Wonder not at my words Charles it is very true your mother owes her death to me—to your father—to your wretched culpable father He who should from duty from gratitude from a sense of his own honour her virtues her angelic virtues have avoided like contagion the most distant means that could wound her mind the thousandth part of a moment much less join with wretches with infamous detestable wretches to work the destruction of her peace and then her life Oh look with pity cried he in agony injured martyred saint and calm the woes that tear me—that destroy me—that feed me with such torturing remorse as would make me think annihilation a blessing My dear boy thou art astonished—
I am indeed sir said Charles but it cannot be I know sir it is impossible The fixed the solemn melancholy with which my indeed incomparable mothers death has shaded your brow makes you see every thing through a sadly deceitful medium and you think the irregularities of your youth sat near her heart But cheer away this melancloly my lord and father let me forego my intention of travelling and stay to comfort you by my watchful and tender duty I will swear to have no joy no employment but the dear pleasing task of exhausting all my little talents to divert and soften your anxiety
My good my noble boy said Lord Hazard I cannot now enjoy a single glimpse of happiness but that which results from reflecting how great how illustrious a figure you will one day make My heart is set on your travelling and the letters I shall receive from you will be all my comfort As for the rest time and reflection sweeted by the friendship of Sir Sidney may restore my health—which I will endeavour to preserve for thy sake—but nothing can give me back my peace of mind This unhappy business which was not a youthful folly but a relapse of honour—Poor boy I little thought when I was schooling thee how much I stood in need of a tutor myself But my words like my deeds want connection I was going to say I would relate this damned business to you by letter with reflections the whole of which together may serve you for an excellent system of advice for it will have both honest precept and dreadful example in one
Charles acceeded to the terms and pledged himself before hand so well he said he knew his fathers excellent heart that in discussing this business be it what it might the guilt would vanish though the cala
ity should remain
My
thanking his son for this earnest of his tender
ty proceeded in more tranquillity to tell him the state of his expectations
Heaven knows my dear my worthy boy said he that it would be the pride of my life could I leave you my her
ditary estate and honours but they are so rigidly tied up that it is impossible All you can have therefore is your mothers jointure amounting to about fifteen hundred a year and what ready money I may die possessed of which I hope will realize for you an annuity equal to that amount and with this fortune I know Sir Sidney will be content to take you for his son in
 Your income till you are of age will be a thousand a year spend this freely I give you leave but do not spend a shilling more If I should die before you return—
Far be that unhappy day said Charles Come sir take leave of melancholy reflections I shall not else have the heart to leave you Indeed I can hardly bear the thought at any rate Warm as my youthful imagination paints the various pleasures of different courts and nations I should be wretched in the midst of them all and alone though in a throng if I thought in my absence my father indulged a single sigh that my presence could suppress
Noble boy said Lord Hazard charming youth adieu your kind words shall serve me for consolation till I have your first letter your first letter till I have your second and thus you see pleasure will accumulate with me—and every post too—for by every post I hope you will write
I will indeed my dear father said Charles but let me not go while you are thus uneasy I feel a reluctance an unspeakable reluctance to leave you There is an inquietude hangs over me that I cannot describe
It is nothing my kind boy said his father but the damp I have thrown on your spirits my letters however will dissipate it I have ever wanted to open my heart to you for I wish to think you as much a friend as a son—Do then by the most tender the most endearing expressions in both qualities hearten me to live to be happy to make thee so thee my good boy my only remaining comfort
Doubt not my whole power my whole devotion said Charles Be assured there is no pursuit upon earth that I shall not consider as secondary to my duty to the best of fathers
And now Charles said my lord almost the happiestof fathers since I see I shall derive so much pleasure from thee
A servant now informed them the chaise was ready A few more reciprocal promises of attention passed after which they joined the company to every individual of which Charles bid a tender adieu till at length having embraced his father with uncommon emotion he burst into a flood of tears hurried with Figgins to the chaise and had got twenty miles before he once opened his mouth
THE YOUNGER BROTHER
BOOK IV
CONTAINING A STILL LARGER FIELD OF ACTION
CHAPTER I
CONSISTING OF POLITENESS A TRIP TO CALAIS AND A CURIOUS DISCOVERY
EVERY thing Mr Figgins had done hitherto was rather a partial rehearsal behind the scenes than the actual performance of his part He now comes forward on the stage where we dare trust him without a prompter so well had he perfected himself in those scenes where he was destined to make his appearance and indeed it were to be wished that other actors whether on the theatre or in the pulpit at the bar at court or any of those many playhouses in the kingdom were—though but for the sake of consistency—half so well qualified to sustain their parts or half so perfect in them
Charles had not twice changed horses in his way to Dover before he had much welcome cause to be charmed with the solicitude of his friend Figgins well knew that to treat a disorder in the mind he must have recourse to a practice the very reverse of that generally adopted with relation to the body therefore instead of nauseous unpalatable draughts in which one would think its professors imagined consist all the secrets of physic he studiously went about to prepare all that he conceived would charm the heart and expand the liberal mind of our hero He drew him from his silence by degrees extolled in the highest terms of admiration his filial piety represented the condition of his father as the workings of a truly amiable mind formerly irregular indeed but now restored to the exercises of reason and benevolence he drew a warm picture of both the power and the will of Sir Sidney to sooth all his cares and finally painted the extreme satisfaction that would result to him by a contemplation that he had one son who would become so great an honour to him as to make noble amends for the obloquy cast upon his name by the despicable ignorance and contemptible conduct of the other
After several similar preparations he began to enter upon the grand subject and at length made his young friend perfectly sensible for what purpose they were then in the post chaise France and all its gaieties began insensibly to blend in their conversation and Figgins archly remarked that gravity was an exotic which certainly would not flourish in so smiling a climate
Charles was ever remarkably tenacious of not permitting his private feelings to inconvenience his friends and the less he conceived himself obliged to restraint by a mans presence the more forward he was to shew that his attention was voluntary—He felt Figginss kindness and began to unbend Besides he had high health and brilliant spirits and however sincerely he might grieve at heart when he reflected—which he certainly very often did for his time of life—sorrow caught but little apparent hold on his volatile mind
Being arrived at Dover they bespoke a passage boat to themselves for the next morning and while it was yet day-light took a walk to see that cliff which Emma had convinced herself by her reading though now the boundary of the channel had certainly in former times made a part of the continent
On their return to supper the landlady informed them that a young lady attended by a footman and a female servant had arrived since their departure and finding that our travellers had engaged the only passage boat on the Dover side expressed an anxious wish that she might be permitted to go half the expence of the vessel and sail with that opportunity for that her affairs called for expedition and she had been also informed that as the wind blew right into Calais harbour there would be no chance of any arrival from thence
It will easily be conceived that the request was instantly complied with though not the terms of it A genteel compliment was instantly returned to the lady with an earnest entreaty that she would suffer the gentlemen to wait on her The interview was permitted the lady was complimented with the offer of a passage for her and her servants which it was delicately hinted to her must be gratis and after as much hesitation as was due to good breeding she accepted the proposal
What Figgins had so successfully began this lady completed She was young handsome and lively and though there appeared now and then a little levity in her manner yet Charles upon Figginss suggestion was willing to attribute it to her extraction and situation the first of which they soon learnt from her own mouth was French and the latter that of a widow
In the course of their conversation it came out to the great satisfaction of our travellers that this young lady by name St Vivier was born in England and the daughter of a French refugee that she married a French gentleman who was proscribed for some overt acts in which he stood up for the liberty of the subject but he now being dead she was going to see what she could collect in France of the scattered remains of his fortune that her journey was to Lyons and being obliged to make some stay at Sedan for intelligence among her late husbands relations she should pursue her rout by the borders of Flanders
As this was step for step the way that had been marked out for Charles what could be so fortunate as the above intelligence This fact was communicated and a proposal suggested that they should make that tour together It was not however mentioned but with the most suitable propriety as to preparation and manner The lady found great difficulty to believe that her route was really that which our travellers had intended to take but saw she said that they were so polite as to alter their intention in compliment to her
Both Charles and Figgins vehemently protested the truth of their assertion and indeed used so many arguments to convince her that it would have been an infringment of that politeness which she seemed to possess in a natural and elegant degree to have
urther doubted their veracity The next difficulty was that it would appear very odd if she should travel in the company of strangers Charles said she had her own servants with her and Figgins noticed that they were all alike strangers in France where indeed no explanations were ever required when people paid their way This she said she should make a point of doing to the utmost farthing if she consented at all but at any rate she must entreat till the morning to consider of the propriety of their proposal
for added she a woman of honour cannot be too cautious especially in such a licentious country as France has been described to me
In this remark both our hero and his friend acquiesced and now supper being announced the lady after some little difficulty was prevailed on to partake of it not however without remarking that matters must be put upon a different footing when they should arrive on the other side of the water To which our hero replied with a very penetrating glance that he sincerely hoped it would be so and upon the ladys looking grave added since it appeared to be her wish
A smart breeze the next day conducted them safely to Calais in something more than three hours where after the customary ceremonies of entering their names paying a visit to the custom-house giving something in charity and satisfying a few clamorous porters they were glad to get hold of some
soup gras
at Desseins which as well as the rest of their dinner they found excellent
In the evening they went to the play which was also performed in the same inn where there is a remarkable neat theatre and by no means small During the performance Charles was greatly pleased with the remarks of Madame St Vivire who spoke French admirably well and perfectly tasted the neat nothingness of the French little operas two of which were that night given Our hero who knew also that language as well as reading could teach it him begged to be this ladys scholar for the practical part of it She readily agreed by which means as he feigned whenever he found it convenient to know less than he did he had a thousand opportunities of indulging himself in a thousand witty sallies by way of trying how a declaration of love would be taken which he the less hesitated to do as a widow at her own disposal was fairly out of his agreement
He first tried his French eloquence to persuade her that the pleasure of her charming company and the advantage of the rapid improvement he should make under her tuition would amply overbalance the expences of their journey At first however she could not think of consenting to this but Charles being strongly seconded by Figgins she at length agreed
This matter set Charles more at ease for he was pretty well assured she could not be a woman of very nice honour who would in this instance yield to the solicitation of two strangers He therefore determined to ply her with the whole force of his amorous eloquence At night he took notice she sipped the burgundy pretty freely which opportunity he seized to insinuate some bold hints which were not ill received Maintaining this ground he had soon reason to think the lady would after a very short siege surrender in form which hopes were confirmed the next morning by Figgins who had already won the ladys woman—both a handsome and genteel girl—and reaped the fruits of his victory
Charles redoubled his assiduity and Madam St Vivier after holding out with great apparent modesty at length reluctantly promised to make him happy on their arrival at Lisle to which place having seen every thing at Calais not forgetting the picture where the citizens are kneeling to King Edward with halters about their necks which curiosity was recommended to his attention by Emma they now prepared to set out
About an hour before the horses were to be ready Mr Dessein begged the favour of an audience with Charles which being granted him after a proper apology and preparation he said he had a matter of great delicacy to communicate which concerned him nearly
Charles expressed some surprise at this declaration and having previously promised at Desseins entreaty that he would in no wise take the matter ill he was informed that some months before a gentleman came to him one morning saying
Mr Dessein I have been robbed of those eighty
louis dors
which I yesterday received from you in a bag
He replied it was impossible that his money might probably be mislaid or found by the servants but that in that house nobody could be robbed He would make enquiry he said and the money would be restored to him
The gentleman went out and at his return Dessein had eighty
louis dors
ready for him in a bag similar to the other for money being in France often paid in three livre and six livre pieces the bankers have all bags on purpose
The excuse made to the gentleman was that as the house was very full the evening before the servant after he was asleep seeing the bag lie on the ground had brought it to one of the clerks who had put it in the counting house for it should be known that Dessein is a banker as well as an innkeeper The gentleman not in the least suspecting the truth of what he heard put the money in his pocket and went away
The fact however which had been so artfully suppressed was this Dessein said he saw in a moment that the gentleman had been really robbed and upon making his enquiries as to the situation of the lodgers he found to a certainty by whom In short he said this crime was committed by a young English gentleman heir to a high title and a large estate that it could not be for want of money as no doubt he might have had what he pleased of his father but finding himself in an immediate necessity instead of applying to him in which case he might have been supplied he took this sum without considering the consequences
Mr Dessein said the resolution he took upon it was to say nothing upon the subject to any person till he should see the young gentleman himself for that out of gratitude to the English to whom he owed his all he would rather lose ten times that sum than make a stir about such a trifle but that having seen that young gentleman since and been treated by him in a very
en cavalier
style though he was determined not to expose him except to his own family he should now certainly make no scruple of applying for the money
In short he informed our hero who began now to smell a rat that Zekiel was the thief
What an opportunity is here to put an end to this history Charles had nothing to do but get his brother hanged to be heir to the family title and estate his marriage with Annette would have followed of course and when they had produced half a dozen children for Lord Hazard to dandle on his knee and comfort himself in his old age he would have sunk peaceably to rest and have left his darling son and daughter in possession of his honours
Whether Charles foresaw an uniform tranquillity in such a life and was determined to experience what sort of pleasures are generally produced by variety or whether—which is full as probable—he felt a strong wish to hide his unnatural brothers frailty we will not enquire Certain it is he without hesitation repaid Mr Dessein upon the spot thanked him for his prudence and represented that he was sorry to see his brother possessed so insolent a spirit but begged he would consider the whole as an extravagant
tour de jeunesse
which had more of false wit in it than premeditated vice He desired that the whole might sink into oblivion and in particular that it might never come to his fathers ears
Mr Dessein promised literally to follow the directions of our hero with whose manner and generosity he was very much struck and could not help remarking that he plainly saw though the honour was vested in the elder brother the younger possessed the virtues which could alone enoble a family
CHAPTER II
STRANGE ADVENTURES AT AN INN—BEING THE HALF-WAY HOUSE THROUGH THIS LITERARY JOURNEY
CHARLES having finished this business greatly to his satisfaction determined that no hint should escape him concerning it not even to Figgins but lest future instances of his brothers nefarious conduct should multiply in a strange country where it would cost him dearly to extricate himself from such difficulties he lengthened a letter he had already written to his father by first very delicately apologizing for touching on such a subject and then entreating that his brothers allowance might be augmented even though his own should be curtailed for that it was impossible for a man in any style to cut a figure in France—particularly a young and inexperienced man—with a slender income He gave some general reasons for this request and though with great deference strongly submitted the matter to his fathers consideration
After entreating Mr Dessein to send any letters forward for him to Lisle he took leave of Calais
At Lisle they purposed staying a few days and as Charles promised himself the possession of Madame St Vivier he was determined to sport as grand a figure as his circumstances would allow—He therefore hired a carriage made parties and gave
petits soupees
at his inn which were of course frequented by as many guests particularly officers and abbes as could beg borrow or steal cards of invitation
One evening about half an hour before supper arrived
un My Lor Anglois
with a gentleman and lady two footmen and a maid servant who could not get so elegant a repast as they wished all the delicacies being taken up by our hero who had invited a large party by way of adieu to Lisle—Charles when he came to understand the inconvenience of the strangers of which he had been innocently the cause upon consulting Figgins sent his compliments and requested as a favour that they would add
sans facons
to the number of those he had invited
The invitation was as freely accepted as given the two gentlemen and the lady presently appeared and were received with all that freedom so common in France The lady was immediately surrounded by the officers and the gentlemen who appeared to be true English sportsmen were hunting out for any body who could speak a word of English Figgins and our hero relieved their distress as much as possible At length supper appeared and presently one of our bucks said to the other
I say you Tadpole if I can think how so many people jabber so curse confoundedly with their jaws full
Oh my lord said his friend a Frenchmans jaws are like the tools of a trunk maker they always make more noise than work
Figgins gave them a hint that they had better be on their guard lest any of the company should understand English
Oh damme said my lord the queer lantern jawed bitches of fellows know no more about English than they do about roast beef only see if they do Mounseer

Monsieur
 answered a very polite abbe
I say said my lord Mounseer how much soup meeger and frogs do you hide away when you can get it in your leather bags of cheeks that look for all the world like the jaw bags of a monkey
The abbe after paying him the utmost attention replied

Monsieur je ne comprend pas un mot
—
Now what the devil faid my lord is
paws umo

He fays he does not understand what you say answered Figgins but you see how open you are yourself for what he said might have been abuse for ought you knew to the contrary
Come sir said my lord no offence to you but I will bet you five hundred and I say done first that if any French rascal in company dares for to offer an affront to me I twigs him a lick of the jaws
At this moment Madam St Vivier said
My Lord Hazard I have the pleasure of drinking your health
To which Charles answered
My dear Madam I thank you give me leave to drink with you that our wishes may be mutual
The stranger who was disputing with Figgins here cried out
Hey whats this Here you Tadpole how is this Here is a gentleman does me the honour to take up my title before I am dead ay and before my old put of a father is dead too
Charles penetrating in a moment the whole force of these few words blushed with indignation which Zekiel perceiving—for the reader sees it was he—followed the blow he had given by saying
Ay damme fine work fine times when every little whipper snapper can set up for a lord
True said Figgins who had a mind to give our hero time for recollection and one may see by your own appearance how contemptible it is—
Nay said Mr Tadpole you must now suffer me to speak sir This gentleman is certainly the eldest son of Lord Hazard who has ridiculously discarded him under pretence of libertine conduct when there is scarcely such an old libertine as himself in existence
Sir said Charles your assertion is a falsity I see this whole business I am by accident in the company of my elder brother who shall not nor shall you sir traduce the character of the most amiable father that ever had existence
Come come said Figgins let the matter now it is explained be as it ought forgotton or at least defer it all the company is gone or till to-morrow morning
I defer it said the young lord
no such thing I assure you—whos afraid of these grinning baboons here
for the Frenchmen had by this time began to shrug up their shoulders and demonstrate other tokens of admiration
My brother Charles here for that is the go I see thinks because he has got a parcel of starve-gutted rips of mounseers about him that a man of my condition damme is to be grinned out of his title
When the title comes to be yours retorted Charles there will be more likelihood of grinning than at present but the matter as Mr Figgins has very properly said should drop which you had better agree to yourself at least for the present if it were only in consideration of your being my guest
Your guest said Zekiel why do you think as I would have come for to eat any of your supper if I had been up to such fine gig as this—
As much said Charles as I would have invited you had I known who you were—as the invitation therefore was sent as from stranger to stranger I am willing to give it another turn to all those who have not understood the dispute and I am sure the whole company will join in laughing it off
Yes and a fine laugh it would be against me hey Tadpole No no damme I will tell them all about it I say Mounseer no my lord he—I my lord

Ah ha
 said an officer without understanding him
Damme if I ever saw such a set of fools in my life said Zekiel
That man no my lord at all I am one great grand my lord myself
Very great and very grand indeed said Charles it is pity that nobody knows it
You are a puppy Mr Charles said Zekiel why the devil dont you help me out Tadpole you can jabber a little of their damned gibberish
Tadpole undertook to inform the company how the matter stood in which account he certainly behaved very scandalously by representing Zekiel as a lord and Charles as an impostor without explaining how innocently the matter had been fallen into Here Charles interfered with all the warmth he could It was however to no purpose
Cest affreux Jesu Maria Cest honteux
and half a dozen other expressions of astonishment were all uttered together and the whole company agreed that they had all along feared our hero was a low born fellow by his prodigality In short a thousand marks of attention were immediately lavished upon Zekiel which being interpreted to him through the medium of Tadpole he swore he never liked French people so well in his life while Charles fortified by indignation against the apostacy of his guests did not now think it worth his while to undeceive them but contented himself with taking this as a caution how he should summon together a promiscuous company in France at his own expence for the future
Figgins however was determined it should not go off so He observed that not one of the company while they bestowed pretty liberally the most humiliating epithets on Charles grudged to eat or drink any thing they could lay their hands on he therefore moved that either nothing should be touched or that they would accompany every word in the manner they had before this discovery with some well-turned compliment to him at whose expence they sat down for as nothing was expected for so sumptuous an entertainment but words—a coin in which they were very rich and very prodigal—he must beg in the name of his friend that they would fulfil the conditions of the feast otherwise it would induce him to wish for a bill that every man might pay his reckoning in another coin with which he did not believe they were so well provided
This sarcasm gave very high offence notwithstanding which they eat and drank on without offering to comply with either of Mr Figginss conditions till at last Zekiel to whom they were explained through Tadpole offered to pay his share and invited his new friends to follow his example
His adherents began now to forsake him no one came into his proposal and all eyes were immediately fixed again upon Charles who seeing what sort of turn matters were likely to take got up and said
Come gentlemen I will end the dispute—Is it not fair that he should be considered as the true Lord Hazard who pays the bill
A general affirmative was instantly given and Zekiel being asked if he would pay the whole expence of the evening out of his pocket answered he would see such a set of mounseers and madames at the devil first Charles then called the waiter who said there was nothing to pay for that his honour had satisfied every thing as well for the supper as the dance and little opera that would enter in a few minutes
Zekiel now under went a thousand mortifications which he contented himself with returning by abuse in a language the Frenchmen could not understand At length he sneaked off to bed vowing revenge against his brother which Mr Flush who as we have said was a follower of his fortunes assured him as he ascended the gallery was easily practicable
I have already said Charles had reason to believe that Madame St Vivier would at Lisle recompense his attention by consenting to make him happy upon his own terms That very night shew was to comply with his wishes and this secret by a means I shall take an opportunity one time or other to explain Mr Flush had discovered and now imparted it to Zekiel who getting instructions as to the situation of all the different bed-chambers determined to supplant his brother
In pursuance of this determination when all was silent in the inn he went to the room where he had been directed and finding it invitingly open fastened the door on the inside and groped about till he found the bed Being accosted by a female voice in a whisper he replied in the same manner He then undrest himself and was welcomed into bed as warmly as he could wish In about half an hour after another person knocked softly at the door whom he of course guessed to be his brother Charles but advising the lady not to take the smallest notice of this intrusion after a short time the importunate visitant gave over knocking and went away
He began now to glory in his success and had a great mind to stay and brazen the whole matter out but was so earnestly entreated by the lady to spare her delicacy and to leave her before the day dawned that he at length complied
Elated with this revenge Zekiel as he occasionally passed our hero in the morning could not help looking big and half insulting him Charles bore every thing very patiently till being obliged to answer an impertinent question or two a very provoking altercation ensued and Zekiel ventured a most invidious and wanton invective against the memory of Charless mother Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when our hero fairly knocked him down and indeed was so transported with passion that he swore he would not rest a moment till he had sacrificed so infamous a rascal to the offended laws
Zekiel being again upon his legs came up and demanded what he meant by that Charles bid him ask Monsieur Dessein At these words Zekiel was in a cold sweat and trembled from head to foot and was actually upon the point of confessing the robbery when Figgins and Mr Tadpole came up-Seeing this Charles in the language of Tamerlane bade him keep his own wicked secret and be safe and asking Mr Tadpole which way they intended to go to England and being answered by the way of Ostend he advised him for the sake of his friend to keep that resolution
Figgins plainly saw there was some hidden meaning in this expression and had indeed though he had not betrayed it thought a little mysteriously of the
tete a tete
interview between Charles and Monsieur Dessein to which another circumstance that occurred at Lisle being added he thought it necessary to tax Charles with want of confidence and pushing the matter while it was warm he obtained from our hero who was the worst qualified in the world for a hypocrite the whole truth
Figgins thanked him for his frankness and said that in return he would give him some intelligence relative to Master Zekiel that would not a little surprise him
He said that being all well flushed the night before every one seemed to have his different appointment For his part he had made an assignation with Kitty Madame St Viviers maid which he went to keep but by some accident or other mistaking the chamber he had certainly introduced himself to Miss Tadpole who it was plain expected somebody for upon finding it impossible to answer many of her questions she was at first in manifest confusion but soon recovering herself gave a turn to the unintelligible part of her conversation and in direct terms made him understand that she took him for Zekiel though what she said was so worded that he plainly saw this was the first interview of that nature which had passed and which she was evidently surprised into owing to her expectation of some other person
Taking the hint therefore he passed himself on her for my lord which indeed spoilt all his scheme of pleasure for the remainder of the night except so much as gratified his curiosity for having yielded to his embraces before matters came to be explained she took on strangely and complained of being ruined in her sleep and all the old cant of those ladies who are well versed in such arts as pass off their stale ware to inexperienced young gentlemen
I topped my part said Figgins for learning from her all those vows and promises which your precious brother has made her I confirmed them with a number of his quaint oaths and at length left her apparently satisfied
I should not forget to mention that after I had been sometime in bed a knocking and a voice was heard at the chamber door on which in her fright she said
that is my brother I know his voice
—and so by the way did I She would have let him in to have witnessed the protestations I had made her This however I overruled and after a time the brother—for I dare say it was he—went away but upon putting all considerations together I am convinced this Mr Tadpole is the ladys gallant and they are trying together to noose your brother which upon my soul I think for the sake of the family ought to be prevented
Charles agreed to this and said if Mr Figgins would confront the lady on their return—for they were now on the ramparts—he would in spight of his inward indignation for his brother try to undeceive him and so save him from this infamy that seemed to await him
Figgins said he was an excellent young man and he would second so laudable an endeavour with all his heart
But said Figgins now we are on the subject of last night you I find kept my appointment for Kitty tells me this morning that some person stole into her room whom she mistook for me but finding her error—but not till she had yielded—made the best of it and humoured the mistake
This is singular enough said Charles I assure you it was not I I was much better employed
Are you sure of it said Figgins—
Oh certain said Charles My assignation was no mysterious one I had no occasion to shroud my designs in darkness for the joys I reaped were heightened by the blushes of my mistress which were revealed to my view by a wax taper which I dare say was bought for a very different ceremony
Then by God said Figgins it was your brother who dubbed me with my harlot while J was dubbing him by anticipation with his wife and I am damnably mistaken if he has not had such anticipaters in the ladys favours for any time this four years
This conversation brought them back to the inn where they found their whole benevolent design rendered abortive for Zekiel and his company had in their absence set out and were now several miles on their journey towards Ostend
Let them go said Figgins and since the fellow will run his nose into the matrimonial gin let him squeak for it but I hope while I reprobate his folly I am not glancing at any in you Madame St Vivier and you are evidently upon very kind terms I need not hint to your good sense that she is a mere adventurer
Oh said Charles that one may plainly see I should like however to know her real story
That for your sake I have discovered said Figgins
Madame St Vivier and her maid are neither more nor less than Aimwell and Archer in the Beaux Stratagem They are travelling to the south of France by the way of Lyons which route I believe they take simply because it is ours On their return by the way of Paris Mrs Kitty is to be the mistress and Madame St Vivier the maid and whatever they pick up in their journey they are to go snacks in The girl acknowledges to me that the first idea was to trap you into a marriage but finding we were too knowing for them and in facts better calculated to administer to their pleasure than their convenience like a couple of generous girls as they are every thing it seems is to be left to ourselves
Which generosity they must not repent said Charles
By no means said Figgins and if in our way we meet with any English booby not your brother let them in Gods name profit of their good fortune
This introduced some general remarks on English travellers which Madame St Vivier interrupted Figgins acquainted her with the discovery as to her scheme and both the gentlemen assured her they would assist it as far as they could without injuring their characters as men of honour
Post horses were ordered to be ready the next morning While they were harnessing Charles having occasion to pay the civility of an adieu to a person in power who had done him some kindness as to his business at the custom-house and other matters had the curiosity to call himself at the post office for he had not yet received a single letter from his father though he had written several—He was there informed that there had been letters but they were fetched away by a footman in a livery exactly like his own the day before Charmed with these tidings he flew back to the inn think-that the footman must have been John who had forgot to give them to him but how great was his surprise when John assured him he had received no letters and offered to go back to the post-office to rectify the mistake whither they immediately set out Figgins begging them to be expeditious for the horses were put to
But stay Charles added Figgins I will tell you as sure as you are alive how the case is Your brothers livery is the same as yours he has intercepted your letters and is now gone the devil knows where and so the unnatural wretch while you were saving his reputation and perhaps his life by your unparalleled liberality in the affair of Dessein—owing I dare say to the cunning of the fellow who travels with him for he has not head enough himself—has hit upon this treacherous plan to make a breach between you and your father
It must be so said Charles but that we may be sure I will write to Dessein to know if he has sent any letters and his answer shall be addressed to Brussels
Well thought said Figgins we can do that from the next post
But stay sir said John I wish I might go to the post-office though I dont believe his honour thinks me guilty
Guilty of what you foolish fellow said Figgins your master knows your fidelity—
Nor will the reader be at a loss how much to lay to the account of it when he is told that this was the very John who upon a former occasion rescued Lady Hazard and refused Dogbolts half-guinea
The last is not the only hint contained in this chapter to which I would have the reader minutely attend It may be necessary probably to revert to it in the course of the work but if it tend to any material circumstances that will more powerfully display themselves by being developed in their place I shall adhere to that rule I have in general set down for myself and only excite present curiosity to strengthen future gratification
CHAPTER III
ONE THEFT ACTUALLY COMMITTED AND A PLAN FORMED FOR ANOTHER
ALL these circumstances together having confirmed Charles in his opinion that Figgins was a sincere friend John a faithful servant and Zekiel a great rogue our travellers took the road to Brussels and at the first stage our hero wrote to Mr Dessein as he had resolved
As I am writing the history of Charles Hazard and not a tour on the continent I shall trouble my readers with no more than such circumstances as immediately concern that young gentleman or lead to his affairs together with such minutiae as naturally produced them and such remarks as may serve for their elucidation
In conformity to these rules I shall only say that at Brussels nothing happened of consequence enough for me to record except that Charles and Figgins became intimate with a young Frenchman named Combrie who had stollen a nun and married her This couple were glad enough to have escaped from France with safety without staying to accomplish a design which they had formed of getting the ladys fortune out of the hands of a trustee in which the church had placed it They were therefore little better off than in the possession of an unbounded stock of love and what money Mr Combrie who was the
cadet
of an honourable family had been able to procure from the fondness of a doating mother
Having however violated one of the most sacred laws of France by carrying a nun out of that kingdom the mettled Frenchman conceived he could incur but little more blame if he pushed his point so far as to take her fortune forcibly out of the hands of a litigeous
procureur
who had made use of the money to his own advantage for two years and eluded every attempt even of the clergy to get it from him
The man of the law was however too vigilant and circumspect for Combrie who being a novice in a matter which required so much wary caution and prudent resolution and besides too much transported with his expected happiness he managed his plan so bunglingly that so far from succeeding with the
procureur
he had very nearly been defeated in his views concerning the lady
Though this couple loved each other with perhaps more tenderness for being without fortune yet most people agree and they could not but yield to the general opinion that money is a security for love especially after reflection takes place Indeed being in a strange country from whence they must shortly for the sake of safety recede further they were not so blinded by their affection but they saw that their future prospects would be in a very doubtful way if some scheme was not hit upon to rescue the money before it could be confiscated for the use of the church
Combrie who had been at Brussels but a short time yet who was looked upon in consequence of his shyness as a very equivocal character saw plainly the danger of making a confident in that place and as an attempt at the recovery of his wifes fortune would be impracticable without a confederate or two taking a hint from the strong congeniality that appeared between the sentiments of our travellers and his own he fancied he should be safe at-least in their confidence even if they did not lend him assistance Besides his affairs were very pressing and he doubted if his resolutions were not suddenly and effectually taken whether the all-grasping power of the church would not deprive him of every possible hope
Having no time to deliberate and being emboldened by the engaging freedom and true breeding of Charles and his friend he ventured without reserve to entrust them with his affairs into which our friends gave so freely that Figgins who the reader knows was no mean hand at a plot concerted one that it was agreed would infallibly succeed even without rendering either him or his friend liable to the smallest suspicion of being concerned in it
Full of their project the three friends set out leaving Madame Combrie in her apartments at Brussels but first sending Madame St Vivier before them to Sedan where she actually had business for as to themselves out of safety to Combrie they travelled to Nancy in Lorraine where lay the scene of action by the way of Luxembourg and in fact as much in Austria as possible till they should come to Metz where they were to hold their grand counsel of war Madame St Vivier however was not at all apprized of their business but only instructed after she had accomplished hers to meet them at Nancy to which Sedan lies in the direct road
Without stopping to look at a single prospect building or even crucifix in the way I shall set down my travellers at Metz where by agreement they separated Charles and Figgins taking post horses for Nancy and Combrie jogging after them at his leisure upon his own horse not however till they had agreed whereabout they should find him in the suburbs near which place Combrie had a trusty friend who he was sure would give him every necessary assistance
Being arrived at Nancy they went to the convent of Chartreux where strangers especially of condition are for a short time treated gratis The members of this convent being all men of fortune and in general such as have retired from the world through disappointments at court are always charmed at the arrival of new guests whether their visits be owing to curiosity or necessity but they are particularly pleased with the English No wonder then that the superior when he understood that Charles was a young English nobleman and Figgins his governor that they had unexpectedly been deceived as to remittances from England and therefore from actual necessity had intruded on their generous institution both for immediate succour and advice instantly signified—especially as their pretensions were corroborated by the testimony of letters of credit and recommendation and many other authentic documents—his warmest wishes to enter heartily into their interest They paid him a number of acknowledgments for his great civility to strangers and said they piqued themselves on their own sagacity which had pointed out the propriety of applying to a man of his piety as well as consequence upon such an occasion rather than run the risk of being imposed upon by an indiscriminate choice of a person to supply their present wants without an eligible recommendation
After this preface our travellers acquainted the superior that they wished his reference to some money negociator for a present supply who assuring them that it would give him particular pleasure to recommend them to some person who should treat them conscientiously mentioned his near relation Monsieur Goufre
le procureur
not however till he had expatiated on the wickedness of those usurious wretches who take advantage of the necessitous and oppress their fellow creatures under the idea of relieving them
Figgins said he had heard of one Monsieur Bancsec but the superior assured them they could not get into worse hands Charles said certainly it would be their interest to rely upon the superiors advice and begged the favour of a note to Monsieur Goufre This request was immediately complied with and our friends went their ways to the gentlemans house in question after thanking the kind recluse in terms of the warmest gratitude
Before however we introduce the reader to Monsieur Goufre it will not be inexpedient to say how Charles and his friend happened to get recommended to the very man who retained Madame Combries fortune
The reader has seen that he was a near relation to the superior of the
Chartreux
which was well known to Combrie and it will not appear extraordinary that this connection with the clergy should be the means of Monsieur Goufres being often employed in matters which concerned the church In fact the frequent litigations by friends of the deceased to recover monies conditionally left for charitable uses on one side and the assertion of the churchs right on the other had upon many occasions produced such a see-saw of interested altercation between the
procureur
and the
superieur
that matters perfectly plain and clear in themselves often wore an air of such mysterious embarrassment under such delusion as frittered large legacies into bills of expences which were cunningly snacked by the lawyer and the monk
One of these lucrative bones at which they had been a long time nibbling was Madame Combries fortune the perfect situation of which nay even the drawer in which it was deposited Figgins undertook to procure intelligence of to do which properly they had recourse to the superior and through him were resolved to attack the heart of his relation in that part where he was most vulnerable—for it was not true that they actually wanted money—and to give a colour to this it was no bad plan to seize an opportunity of taking the
Chartreux
by the outward symbol of his profession and make his charity which was counterfeit the instrument of his real confusion
Combrie being arrived in the Fauxbourg and informed of their resolves the moment came to put their design in execution Charles and Figgins waited on the
procureur
who after all the necessary difficulties which upon motion was to be removed by Monsieur Dessein agreed to accommodate them with what they should think necessary for they had represented that they should change their route so often and probably from momentary inducements that it would be better to take up in specie as much as would serve for some months and leave in the hands of Monsieur Goufre travelling bills of Sir James Herries and other English bankers to the amount of the sum and the discount
Nothing retarded the payment of the money but waiting for a letter from Monsieur Dessein which at length arrived greatly to the satisfaction of all parties It spoke very handsomely of Charles and his friend and it is proper to mention that over and above the business of assuring Monsieur Goufre it mentioned that letters had been sent to Charles at Lisle on account of which he had written to Brussels and this confirmed Charles in his opinion of Zekiels treachery Figgins however made a different use of this circumstance greatly turning it to their present account for he proved very clearly that if those letters sent to Lisle had been received the application to Monsieur Goufre would have been unnecessary
During the interval between writing to Calais and receiving an answer Charles and Figgins had twice dined with the
procureur
and the latter had so insinuated himself into his good graces that under pretence of enquiring into the practice of the French laws he wormed out of him almost all his affairs The endowments of the monasteries naturally came up in their conversation in which business he owned he was very much employed and one morning when they were talking in the counting-house upon this subject the
procureur
said as he was locking up his bureau
here now is a pretty large fortune which has been lessened almost one-fourth by litigation It belonged to a nun who has been lately stolen from a neighbouring monastry—there it is labelled and sealed up in notes upon the
Caisse daccompte payable au porteur—
and I have now a supreme order which I shall yield to next week—after I have made out my bill against it—to surrenderit to the Lady Abbess
Naturally guessing that nuns were not so frequently stolen but that her he had heard of must be Madame Combrie Figgins found his point so far gained and now the letter being arrived from Calais nothing remained but to receive their money
On the evening appointed for this business the
procureur
was invited by our travellers to a sumptuous entertainment at the Hotel
DAngleterre—
Before supper the ceremony of signing and sealing was performed and after supper all was hilarity Figgins made the
procureur
harrangue Charles prevailed on him to squall several
chansons a boire
and Madame St Vivier who arrived at Nancy that very afternoon took him out to walk a minuet with her In short the votary of chicane having made a good bargain a good supper and fallen violently in love with Madame St Vivier did not notice how the hours wore and was at length after a good finishing dose carried to bed in a condition that laid him by the heels till ten oclock the next morning
CHAPTER IV
IN WHICH THE LAITY PROVE TWO CUNNING FOR BOTH LAW AND GOSPEL
IT was three hours after Monsieur Goufre went home before he discovered that any trick had been played him for I hope the reader does not suppose the supper was given for nothing He asked one of the clerks if any body had called while he was engaged the evening before and was answered nobody of any consequence but Father Benedick—
What Father Benedick said Goufre
Him said the clerk we sent to you at the
Hotel DAngleterre
and by whom you sent your keys with written orders to deliver the fortune belonging to the convent of our lady of the ascension
Written orders Keys cried the astonished
procureur
But it is impossible here are my keys
Well sir these are the keys he brought said the clerk and here is the order surely we know your hand writing
Upon this Monsieur Goupe read in a faultering accent and in a hand so like his own that he could himself find no difference
Let Father Benedick have the packet in the bureau labelled Money belonging to the convent of our lady of the ascension
As all the French dance well it is not wonderful that Monsieur Goufre had scarcely read these words when he took a
chassee
to the bureau where he discovered the nest without the bird
caprioled
back to the parlour for his hat and cane
rigadooned
to the door
briseed
out of it and in a new fashioned
pas courant
presently made an
entre
at the house of the general of the police There being joined by a proper number of figurants under the characters of
sergeants du ville archets
and
pouse culs
the
procureur
paraded at their head to the
Hotel DAngleterre
where to enrich the procession back again he entreated our hero Figgins and Madame St Vivier to perform a
pas de trois
In plain English he fairly believed his pocked had been picked while he was asleep and that our travellers who were thieves had taken this method to rob him and having imparted these suspicions to the general of the police he obtained an order to bring the delinquents before him
A few words however served to convince that officer and even the
procureur
himself that his suspicions were groundless The clerk deposed that about seven oclock in the evening a person in the garb of a friar calling himself Father Benedick came to their house and said he had particular business with Monsieur Goufre relative to a certain fortune belonging to the convent of our lady of the ascension He represented that upon various pretences it had been so long kept out of the churchs hands that it was in agitation to procure a suspension of the
procureurs
employments if he should refuse immediately to deliver it He said it was pity Monsieur Goufre was not within for his authority was so powerful and decisive that if he returned it would be with force which he would willingly avoid The clerk said in consequence of these menaces he made no scruple of sending the supposed friar to his master who about a quarter before eight returned with Monsieur Goufres keys and a written order to deliver the fortune which was locked up in the bureau and which had a label similar to that described in the said written order The clerk swore he believed it to be the hand writing of his master and he was sure the keys were those his master then held in his hand
Mr Figgins here entreated that he might have permission to ask the
procureur
a few questions which request being complied with he said
Pray sir in whose company were you from half past six oclock till nine during which time this fraud is said to have been committed
Monsieur Goufre answered in his company—
Were you not said Figgins during that whole time in your sober senses
Perfectly answered the man of law
And now let me rouse your best recollection while I ask if in that very interval of time you were not talking of your extensive business of your property and indeed of this very fortune you now say you have lost but which you then bragged you had safely locked up as a proof of which you shewed us those very keys and at the very time as it should seem that your clerk was using them—which is a very likely story—to deliver that fortune up to a person he had never before seen
The poor
procureur
felt this unanswerable mode of reasoning most severely and the general of the police—whether other cases had induced him to doubt the veracity of Monsieur Goufre or whether he was conscious that Englishmen are constantly upon these occasions not those who dupe but those who are duped—seemed to pay great attention to Figginss harrangue who seeing his advantage thought he could not do better than follow it up which he did in these words
Upon the whole it appears to me and so it shall to the English embassador that Monsieur Goufre having found in us a pretty free-milch cow as to some money transactions we have had together has fancied notwithstanding the documents we have produced that we could not make good our pretensions to rank and independency and therefore imagined we might be awed by the accusation of a sham robbery into a composition and this appears from many circumstances—What had we to do with this fortune Why were we to know in what place it lay Why have we been repeatedly shewn the key that locked it up Besides the matter has been so bunglingly managed that the clerk deposes that very key was sent at the individual time he himself confesses to have had it in his pocket Then he does not pretend to say that the hand writing is not like his but on the contrary so like that he should have taken it for his own But it was necessary this should be said because if the hand writing had not been exactly like his the clerk would have had no pretence whatever to have delivered the fortune Again what was this same Father Benedick—and how had he got all this intelligence How insinuated himself into his pocket invisibly and conveyed away the keys during an interval of perhaps the only five minutes in an hour and a half that they had been trusted there without his hand upon them for their security but at any rate to make the story in the smallest degree colourable what connection had this supposed Father Benedick with them to lend the smallest probability to their being concerned in a transaction so very derogatory to their honour as gentlemen so totally unnecessary to their circumstances which Monsieur Goufre had taken care with the most scrupulous exactness to make himself master of—and so disgraceful to the name of Englishmen How had it been proved that they so far from knowing the friar in question had a single associate even of their own country—for both the clerks gave very clear testimony that Father Benedick spoke with an accent so pure and vernacular that they were sure he was a Frenchman and indeed so he was All these circumstances considered it was impossible this affair should be otherwise than a gross attempt—an event which occurred too frequently—to impose upon English credulity which however others might pass over would not in the present instance be regarded in any light either trifling or pardonable on the contrary it would be found that men of character had been tampered with who were both able and willing to right themselves He therefore insisted for the sake of general justice and the honour of the English nation that the matter should be fully and publicly investigated to which and they would be content to submit to a temporary imprisonment provided Monsieur Goufre should be laid under the same restriction
The general of the police whou could not probably see that all this intelligence had been by the most subtle train of artful insinuation deliberately drawn from Goufre by Figgins with a view to forward the designs of Combrie—who the reader sees was father Benedick—had no manner of doubt but that every word he had heard was truth
His own private opinion indeed was that being in a short time to deliver up the fortune the
procureur
had conjured up the whole accusation to cover his embezzlement of the money As to the friar he had not the least doubt but that he was a real character procured probably by his relation the superior of the Chartreux who as we have said was occasionally concerned with Mr Goufre in his law practices
In short he so well knew as he thought the trim of the business that he would not have hesitated to comply with the terms of Mr Figgins had he not had some very material objections to get rid of
In the first place he well knew that their knowledge of each others illicit conduct was mutual they had trod together the paths of oppression and it was their constant custom when either was likely to get into a scrape to call the other to his assistance In the present case however the
procureur
had previously sworn to the general of the police that he had actually been robbed and this was indeed the truth but matters—thanks to Figginss address—wore now so different an aspect that this seeming want of confidence quite exasperated him and nothing but his own actual safety made him hesitate a moment to take part against the
procureur
Balancing thus between his conviction and his interest he thought proper to pursue a middle course He said as there had actually been nothing proved which had been alledged he could not answer sending to prison three persons one of them a lady who had made so handsome a defence Monsieur Goufre had certainly in the first transports of his resentment done what he thought very justifiable but what upon reflection had neither certainty nor even probability to support it that it was plain he had been some way or other tricked how would very likely hereafter appear and if he had been too warm stung as he was at being deprived of a large deposite which it would cut deep into his fortune to make good those very traits of liberality on which that gentleman—meaning Figgins—had dwelt would he hoped induce him and his friend to overlook surely a very pardonable error
Charles said Monsieur Goufres mad manner of rectifying a mistake he thought deserved no lenity at their hands For his part he should detest the idea of patching up a matter that struck so hard in him at the honour of every young nobleman on his travels He should think if he passed by such a glaring impertinence every one of his English acquaintance ought to resent it He should therefore acquaint the English embassador who was his fathers particular friend of the whole business without the smallest reserve and if he must endure to have a hated liberty forced upon him he would at least let his inconvenience be what it might stay in that town till not only himself and his friend should be handsomely cleared but till he who had the audacity to scandalize their characters should meet with his merited punishment So saying he gave the lady his hand and said if their forms would admit it he should chuse to go from that place but that he should be found at the
Hotel DAngleterre
till the matter was finally decided
They were followed out by the general of the police who whispered Figgins in the hall that he plainly saw Monsieur Goufre had done a rash thing but that it need not hinder them from pursuing their tour for if they would leave twenty guineas in his hands he would take care as much justice should be done to their honour as if they were present
In this I verily believe he spoke truth but Figgins cut him short with this reply
Sir If the law has any power over us use it now you have us in your custody if not the best of you shall have reason to repent this outrage and as to leaving twenty guineas in your hands I would do it with great pleasure were I not unluckily bound by a vow not to trust any Frenchman further than I can see him
The general of the police said it was a great pity so good an opportunity should be lost and added that perhaps the young gentleman was not bound by the vow
Charles said he was always bound by the determinations of his governor especially when they went to a prevention of his being duped
The general of the police not thinking fit to urge the matter any farther after many reverences retired to the
procureur
after which our travellers departed first giving the officers of justice something to drink
Monsieur Goufre was found by his friend in a state of distraction The latter however believed it all put on and began very severely to upbraid him with his duplicity and to blame him for having made such a fool of himself
The
procureur
swore that he had been robbed and was ruined and confirmed the oath with a hundred others He was unfortunate enough however to gain no manner of credit on the contrary the general of the police told him in so many words that since he was above placing confidence in his friends he sincerely wished the Englishmen might trounce him
This introduced a warm bout at alternate recrimination till at length both became cool and they determined in conjunction with the superior of the Chartreux to take an early opportunity of deliberating on the most expedient means to get out of such a disagreeable scrape
CHAPTER V
AN EXPLANATORY LETTER—A LITTLE VEXATION—AND A JOURNEY TO LYONS
MADAME St Vivier had not the smallest idea that her companions really knew any thing of the fraud She had acted her part to perfection the night before as to making Monsieur Goufre drunk and ridiculous but was ignorant that the trick went any further than getting good terms from him as to the money that was borrowed neither had a syllable of the situation of Madame Combrie been explained to her for it is natural to suppose our travellers did not so sin against good breeding as to introduce such a character into that ladys company She might be sent purposely to Dover and probably was intended to be played off as a
corps de reserve
upon our hero but when no direct outrage on propriety was necessary Mr Figgins was too great a general to call in assistance when every thing went on even beyond his wishes But how beyond his wishes Patience dear reader I would not have you know what is brewing just at present for any consideration Attend then and let the fruit of your curiosity ripen by degrees nor—that it may have the better relish—wish to gather it till it shall be ready to drop into your hand
Four or five days after the affair of the general of the police the
procureur
waited on our travellers with great deference and respect and informed them that he had received a letter which had satisfied him in every point relative to the fraud He therefore acquitted them so heartily of any concern in that matter that he appeared extremely shocked at his conduct and said he would publish their innocence coupled with any acknowledgment of his own by way of concession that they should think proper to dictate As to himself he had the pleasure to inform them that as it was now known he had not been to blame at the mediation of his relation the superior of the Chartreux and his friend the general of the police the chapter of the convent to which the money was due had remitted the payment of it till his death provided he would then add the interest of it and an additional bequest of ten thousand crowns
The letter to Monsieur Goufre was as follows—
TO MONSIEUR GOUFRE
SIR
Lest your clerks or any other innocent persons should suffer under the suspicion of having taken from your bureau that fortune which in justice and equity is mine in right of my wife I write this to acquaint you that on Friday evening last about seven oclock I called at your house habited like a friar and under the name of Father Benedick demanded the fortune in your hands belonging to the convent of our lady of the ascension intimating that if I did not see you be where you might I should return prepared to compel you to resign it Your clerks referred me to you at the
Hotel DAngleterre
from whence I feigned to return at about a quarter before eight bringing with me a written order as if from you—a duplicate of which I have enclosed to shew you how well I counterfeited your hand writing—and a bunch of keys one of which opened your bureau One of your clerks so completely imposed upon naturally gave me what I wanted I immediately departed derobed myself of my holy accoutrements mounted my horse and rode through bye-ways till I arrived at Rouen —first taking care to touch the
Argent Comptant
which as you know I was easily enable to do as the whole fortune was in notes on the
Caisse daccompte
at Paris payable
au porteur—
from whence when I shall have put this letter in the post a vessel will carry me to Guernsey and before it can reach you I shall be in England
It may not be amiss to tell you that the key which opened your bureau I caused to be made from your own for which purpose I took care to be very much about you before I stole my dear Araminta from her hypocritical directress I knew it always accompanied four others the size of which did not escape my notice two of them open chests one a small cabinet and the least a casket
All these matters lent such strong probability to my story with which my holy garb so well agreed—a garb which was never used to a worthier purpose—that it was impossible for me not to succeed
If this confession will do you any good with the church you are welcome to make what use of it you think proper As to myself I shall glory in its publication for I am sure the money that serves to maintain an honest pair whose views are honourable and their actions exemplary—but more especially as that money is their right—is more worthily nay more religiously applied than in fattening and encouraging in licentiousness those slothful drones who as you and I know shut themselves up from the world not to cherish holiness but to hide profligacy
From Yours &c COMBRIE
This letter which speaks so plain completes the account of Figginss scheme which I have thus piece-meal explained to the reader The circumstance of the keys which was a fact together with the knack which Combrie had of imitating Goufres hand writing—which indeed is not difficult for almost all Frenchmen write alike—gave a hint of it and the idea of an application to the superior of the Chartreux and all those concurrent circumstances which we have seen so well managed could not fail to crown it with success
This history then has so far acted in its customary province as to make one couple happy already How long they are to continue so it is not impossible but we may hereafter have occasion to notice
It will easily be seen that this affair ended greatly to the honour of our travellers who in consequence attracted the notice of all the English who then resided at Nancy Among the rest they were visited by a gentleman whose company as a plain straight-forward well-meaning man was very agreeable to them He served admirably well to make one at a party of whist and for a cursory acquaintance really was not without his merit
A very short time however let them into the character of this new acquaintance whose name was Ireland for one night being at whist with Mr Figgins for his partner Charles was so tantalized into betting and confused off his guard that he got up from the table an hundred and fifty pounds loser in spight of all the hints and expostulations of Figgins who only played for crowns
The next day he heard from undoubted authority that Mr Ireland was an errant sharper and had escaped from England after killing a gentleman in a duel who had dared to tax him publicly with a palpable fraud
This loss however had one good effect upon our hero for he made a most solemn vow never again to lose five pounds at one sitting which resolution he inviolably kept to the day of his death
I have said very little of Charless continual disappointments at not receiving letters from his father or indeed any body else since his departure from England The truth is that it gave him inexpressible concern and occasioned from him many and various remonstrances which were apparently very little heeded
Figgins testified as much uneasiness as our hero but upon this as well as every other subject he comforted him by a variety of arguments He said it very often occurred that people on a tour missed of their letters though at length they came safely to hand that at Nancy for example it was sometimes three weeks before a man could write a letter and receive an answer to it and this inconvenience would encrease in proportion as they went farther There was no doubt he said but every thing would fall upon its legs and the letters would all come together in a lump and he cheerfully agreed to wait at Lyons till every proper explanation could be mutually exchanged not only as to Charles and his father but every other correspondent
This kind accommodation in Figgins gave our hero great pleasure He had really at times felt very unpleasantly on this subject and though he could account for his disappointment at Lisle yet more than two months had elapsed since that time during which interval he had repeatedly written in such a full and satisfactory manner that he could not bear to reflect on the parting between him and his father and at the same time hold in mind that all his attempts to learn the state of that amiable parents mind were continually baffled He knew not what might have happened in his absence he had dreaded to leave him nay he would not think on the subject it was dreadful to him yet he could not give a reason for it Who knew but the letters received at Lisle since he had heard nothing afterwards might give an account of an unfavourable alteration in his fathers health perhaps they contained a tender injunction to come and close the dying eyes of an indulgent parent perhaps he was then dead and the letters were from friends who gave him the melancholy news which his perfidious brother had received with a triumphant and cruel joy
Reflections like these greatly embittered the enjoyments of our hero and though I have not thought it necessary to present the reader with any thing but the agreeable side of the picture yet it is certainly true that Charles had his moments when he felt very severe and bitter unhappiness nay he had once very nearly determined to return to Calais the better to investigate this unpleasant business though the natural gaiety and I will say honesty of his disposition prevented his particular griefs from interfering with pleasures in which others were concerned What wonder then if the kind consoling advice of Figgins kept his mind in that tranquillity which made it impossible for an unconcerned person to penetrate his chagrin
I have conceived it necessary to say thus much lest the reader should think our hero had in imitation of some other heroes left his feeling in his own country and that his foreign freaks—every one of which I undertake to contend had a defensible motive—were merely the common effect of that fashionable conceit and supercilious levity which are the qualities the French have in general a right to take as a sample of English manners
All affairs at Nancy being properly settled Charles began to be very impatient for their departure to Lyons Before they set out however he drew up a recapitulation of all his other letters to which he added many earnest entreaties and that it might be sure to go safe entrusted it to the care of Figgins himself who insisted upon putting it in the post office swearing he began to suspect every body and when he returned said that Master John should not be so confidently trusted for the future
Why so said Charles
Nay no great matter answered Figgins
I begin to have my suspicions of him but perhaps these devils of women have corrupted him
Charles asked his friend what induced his suspicions Figgins said
I caught the rascal in a lie that is all which I cannot bear Damme if there is so pimping a thing upon earth as an unnecessary lie
From a person in whom you place confidence said Charles there cannot be a crime of such magnitude As death is better than torture so open enmity is better than hidden deceit Even a trifling lie in such circumstances may conceal the most tremendous consequences For my part I look upon plain integrity to be so positively essential in the composition of a friend that though I were one mass of imperfections I would forgive the continual reiteration of them both to myself and the world rather than they should be hyperbolically glossed over On the contrary if I thought the man I trusted could even meditate a wish to deceive me let my partiality be what it might I would tear him from my heart even though it should burst in making the effort
Figgins who had eyed our hero with extraordinary tokens of amazement while he animatedly pronounced these words first looked pale then red but recovered however in time to put in for his share of this honest opinion and after an eulogium on Charless way of thinking and reflecting on John who alone he chose to understand as the person all this warmth was levelled at he finished his remark with
Damn the fellow I should be sorry to find him a rascal for I have a regard for him
Charles certainly had no particular meaning in the words he had uttered but his disappointment at not hearing from his father gave him occasionally a kind of peevish discontent as if he found somebody had deceived him though he knew not who As a proof that he had not the smallest mistrust of Figgins he entrusted him as we have just seen with his letter to put in the post office yet he was scarcely gone but he wished he had taken it himself though he sincerely believed this wish a tacit though an involuntary injustice to his friend
The contents of his letter next were gone over in his mind in which he found nothing but a repetition of disappointments that for ought he knew would be rewarded with new ones especially as he was confident in his own mind they originated in some secret cause which he had not been nor should ever be perhaps able to penetrate In this trim of thinking when Figgins returned and dropt those hints concerning John out came the very soul of our hero and so it would have done had his own ruin been the consequence
Figgins—for what reason perhaps the reader may conceive—verily believed this thrust was at him and though he not only saw he had well parried it but as he firmly believed disarmed his young friend of all suspicion yet he feared that should he take in his head to arm himself frequently with these impatient doubts as he did not want for skill in these sort of conflicts he Figgins might one day or other receive such a hit as might prove a mortal stab to all his hopes of bringing those schemes to bear which he certainly for some reason or other was concerting for though I have constantly allowed that Charles was credulous he could not be grossly imposed upon and no man knew this better than Figgins who with all his management would not have been able easily to gain his ends which were now—though the reader as I have said must wait with patience to know how—nearly accomplished had not a series of unexpected events concurred to give him a helping hand
CHAPTER VI
FULL OF INTERESTING MATTER—AND AMONG THE REST TWO DEATHS
OUR travellers arrived at Lyons after a safe and pleasant journey They visited every thing curious were frequently at the play made acquaintance with men of condition and taste and in short here as in other places availed themselves of every opportunity of improvement thus fulfilling the real purposes of travelling
These matters however I have even less time to particularize here than I had heretofore and therefore shall leave to the readers imagination what was the employment of a young man and his governor who were really ambitious of returning home with as much knowledge as they could pick up but which acquisition Charles in particular—as the reader shall hear—became possessed of more than he wished
Our hero walking one day in a field beyond the ramparts was meditating on a small book in the midst of a grove when he heard behind him a rustling Directing his eyes to the place from whence the noise issued he saw two men very warmly attacking each other with drawn swords In the impetuosity of his first sensations he bounded like a fawn to the place and drawing to part the combatants one of them like Mercutio was hurt under our heros arm He faultered out

Oh Jesu Je suis mort

and fell down
Charles was so dreadfully shocked at this accident that he thought of nothing but endeavouring to succour the wounded person on which charitable employ he was so intent that he did not pay the smallest regard to the other who upon seeing his antagonist drop fled with the fwiftest precipitation
A moments recollection convinced our hero that he was in a most singularly perilous situation The poor wounded wretch seemed to be dying and every circumstance would serve to make it believed that he was the murderer Nevertheless his strong humanity so prevailed over his prudence that he ran without the wood and holloed to the centinel upon the ramparts for help telling him there was a man dangerously wounded
Several gentlemen who were walking on the ramparts presently came up to whom Charles related but not without much confusion—for he was most exceedingly affected—the whole matter as it had passed Unfortunately his relation gained very little credit They all knew the nature of duelling and naturally imagined a prudent person would upon such an occasion go another way rather than interfere with two men who were agreed upon fairly deciding a quarrel by the law of arms
Charles was astonished when he understood their suspicions and could not help asking with some disdain whether the French always requited the good offices of strangers in the same manner One or two of the gentlemen took heat at this and said he should answer every thing at large before the general of the police
Charles treated their menaces with perfect indifference relying upon the testimony of the dying man who however left his protector in the lurch for after an ineffectual attempt to speak he pointed to Charles and falling backward expired
This action was universally allowed to have been intended as a sign to distinguish the murderer and what strongly corroborated the general opinion was our heros sword which was very much stained with blood It was in vain that he accounted very naturally for this circumstance by saying that when he first saw the dead man fall he abandoned his sword the better to lend him assistance and that of course as it lay the blood which ran in a stream had fallen upon it
This was construed into cunning and art In short the guard arrived and he was conducted to the house of the general of the police comforted however with

Courage on pardon en France un coup de vivacite

In spight however of these comfortable tidings Figgins who had been waiting for our hero to breakfast at their inn was very soon summoned to breakfast with him in prison
Figgins insisted upon it in the strongest terms that it was impossible his friend could be concerned in this business otherwise than as an accidental mediator The gentleman who had fallen was a man of some consideration resident in that place where Charles was an absolute stranger and had not the smallest acquaintance He offered to swear that till this unhappy morning he had never been a single ten minutes out of his company since his arrival in Lyons and how could so serious a quarrel have engendered without previous malice—without the smallest acquaintance with the unfortunate person or even knowledge that any such man had existence He maintained there was not upon earth a less turbulent spirit than his friend that his disposition was the sweetest mildest most benignant in the world that there could not be in nature a more benevolent heart He would answer with his life that was the fact as they suspected his young friend had not the soul to be guilty of such low such treacherous baseness as to disown it On the contrary as no laws were so lenient as to accidental rencounters as those of France so far from denying what had happened he would feel enough at having been the destruction of a fellow creature however unintentionally without adding guilt to misfortune by excusing himself at the expence of a wilful lie
Besides these arguments Figgins insisted that they had not consulted even common probability in this business His friend had averred that the murderer fled Who was he then No people were so remarkably provident as to who went and came as the French Let the book of the general of the police be consulted and see who had retired from the town If he was a settler it would easily be known if a stranger intelligence of him might be gathered at the place where he lodged As to the action of the dying man he was assured it had been intended to point out his friend as one who had endeavoured to preserve him In short he said let the matter but have time and be maturely investigated and he would resign himself as an accomplice and willingly await the same fate staking his own life upon the issue of his friends innocence
This manly and noble speech which was made in presence of some of the most considerable people of Lyons had its effect It was warmly agreed even by the relations of the deceased—who by the bye got a fortune by his death—that every thing ought to be well considered Accordingly the term of six weeks was fixed to make all the necessary enquiries at which time it was intended if nothing happened to exculpate our hero that he should be brought to trial
It was now the business of Figgins to alleviate as much as possible the distresses of his friend—he had however very little comfort for him It had been found that a stranger had actually absconded on the very morning this sad affair happened but as the inland towns in France are not so particular as to mere strangers as the sea-ports he could not learn his name He asked Charles if he had no idea who the murderer was Charles said he had scarcely given him a single look so instantaneously was the mischief done and that from that moment he had not seen him at all his whole care having been directed towards the dying man but notwithstanding all these disadvantages he was sure he had somewhere seen him though it was then utterly out of his power to recollect when or where
In a few days after the imprisonment of our hero Figgins came to him and said he was greatly afraid there was some damned plot in the business for that the women were gone off and had taken John with them
What plot can there be said Charles
In this situation they are tired of us and resolved to shift for themselves a very common resolution for creatures of their stamp
True said Figgins but how will you reconcile the conduct of Mr John I will tell you what has lately struck me
What said Charles
Why answered Figgins that this same Madame St Vivier is known to Mrs OShocknesy and if so there is no mischief however detestable but you may apprehend That woman has the hypocrisy of
crocodile the heart of a tygress and the malic
of the devil She delights in mischief it seems to be as requisite to her existence as food there is not such an infernal succubus in human nature and may I be damned—for our friend Figgins would sometimes swear—if it were my fate to chuse whether to encounter the anger of a hungry lion or groan under the influence of a plot against me prepared and inflicted by that she fiend if I would not trust the claws of old Leo rather than the diabolical fangs of Mother OShocknesy
Now you may remember continued Figgins I caught Master John in a lie It was this—Kitty had told me she had seen this gentleman of ours very busily employed in a familiar conversation at Lisle with that fellow of your brothers Flush whom by the way I never liked—indeed I know Mr Standfast turned him off on account of his attachment to Mrs ODevil Why Mrs Kitty told me this I remember I thought very odd at the time but catching from it at the moment an idea concerning the embezzlement of the letters I with more bluntness than wit taxed the gentleman with his intimate acquaintance with Mr Flush which he denied and which Kitty confirmed to his face It was this determined me to take your letters myself and this has kept me ever since upon my guard as to this fellow and finding now which way he inclines it is more than possible he has been a rascal all along and that even the half-guinea he refused from Sir Daniel Dogbolt was a feint through which he acted according to his instructions
Charles said he had never correctly understood that business or what it alluded to nor had he known more than that some difference had happened between his father and mother which had been happily adjusted through the mediation of Mr Standfast
Figgins said when his mind could bear the relation he would acquaint him with all the particulars exactly as it had been related by my lord to the surgeon at the John of Gaunts Head and who he said had spight of all Standfasts care not preserved the secret so sacredly as a man of his profession ought This however did not happen to be the truth for it was through Mr Standfast and no other person that Mr Figgins came by his intelligence
But said Figgins to finish with this dear harmless lady whom I so dearly love if she has any hand in your affairs you may be assured it will be productive of mischief to you both in England and here
Charles said he had no doubt of the gentlewomans kind offices but yet he saw no harm that could come of them for his father was pretty well upon his guard against her and as to his own conduct it was he flattered himself at least in material points not such as to merit reproach
All I wish said he is to hear from my dear father if he remain safe from the malice of our enemies I will forgive every thing they can do to me
This subject however was never out of Figginss mouth and indeed though nothing could be managed with more cautious delicacy one would think he had an inclination to sink his friends spirits till he should be inclined to save the trouble of a public trial by hanging himself in his prison
All this however was not sufficient to damp the spirits of our hero though I must own his situation seemed a good deal to tire his patience He had so invariably adhered to those principles which at his outset in life he had so invariably laid down for himself that conscious of his own innocent intentions he did not believe it possible that he could sink under the weight of injustice He therefore entreated his friend—who as the trial approached put on looks more and more rueful—to make himself easy
How can I said Figgins All the devils in hell one would think conspire against you I declare to God to see virtue like yours so oppressed is enough to make one curse ones being and wish rather to be the vilest reptile than a human creature
And then would he enumerate the damned things as he called them that had fallen out to thwart the good intentions of our hero and these would he follow up with his apprehensions for his safety then cut a little out of the way to take a wipe at that fury in petticoats Mrs OShocknesy then curse then hope then shudder then admire again the fortitude of his friend and then exclaim that in such an infernal world as this it was not worth while to be virtuous for that none but rascals were happy
It was about two days before the trial when he had one morning wound up or rather let down our hero by similar remarks to these that he undertook to go through the whole business of Miss Snaffle with all its consequences which really shocked Charles to such a degree that his spirits were scarcely able to bear it Seeing this Figgins cursed himself for his inconsiderate rashness Said he
My unconquerable friendship makes me a fool and in proportion as you are oppressed you so creep into my heart that out of complaisance to your curiosity I do the very things which unman you when—if like other men I had more art than honesty—I should try to render you callous to your fate rather than melt you into almost a desire to meet it But come Charles added he embracing him I will stand by you nobly and if you must fall you shall not want a friend to revenge you
In this delightful mood did this kind friend permit Charles to remain for that day On the next he entered his friends apartment with a most cheerful countenance saying there was long-looked-for come at last and with these words presented a packet of letters which he said were just arrived by the post but that was not all another parcel had been left at their bankers which he supposed contained the whole of his fathers letters ever since he left England
Charles who had hastily catched at the first letter that came to his hand opened it and found it from Sir Sidney He wondered to see it begin with Sir but getting to the second line while Figgins was uttering those last words which he did not hear he exclaimed
Merciful God
—and fainted away
Assistance was summoned and he recovered when having raved himself almost into another swoon he became stupid with horror At length he grew more calm and being entreated by his friend to bear his fortunes like a man he gathered composure enough to read the following words
TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ
SIR
It is my duty to inform you—though I scarcely think it will give you any pain—that your father is no more He died suddenly—Rumour will too soon tell you how but shudder to think that your excesses have shortened his life
Those excesses which are at your age and for the short time in which you have committed them the most shocking that ever were heard of have been but too well authenticated to us therefore upon no account will I either see you or hear from you
You are willed by your exasperated and unhappy father—who had not the heart to alter his first intentions—your mothers jointure which is thirteen hundred a year and the interest of nine thousand pounds both for your life I am sole executor but as I am firmly resolved to have no sort of communication with you Mr Balance will honourably negociate this business
My determinations are unalterable therefore all attempts to deter me from them will be useless
SIDNEY WALTER ROEBUCK
Do I live Am I awake cried Charles staring wildly
My excesses shortened my fathers life What have I done Heavenly God I shall go distracted
Mrs OShocknesy said Figgins
Did I not tell you so She saw the fathers life hung on his son and like a merciless damned harpy as she is slandered away the reputation of one to destroy the existence of the other I am sure of it I would stake my soul that it is a fact
Alas my poor father said Charles how properly is this a sequel to the wretched business of yesterday But I to be the cause of his death I who would have given a thousand lives—infamous as I am—to save his Oh my forboding heart why did I part from him But he could not believe it What are my villanies Is it my crime or my virtue that has brought me here Surely surely thus attacked Innocence may defend itself
Yours is immaculate said Figgins and I will maintain it nor indeed will any body doubt it when we come to England The villany has reached its consummation all its purposes are effected It will be easily found a mistake it will be palliated glossed over but how will it bring your father from the grave But come we have need of all our senses at this moment let us collect them manfully we have no guilt to sink us whatever our accusers may Come Charles resolution man I have been the partner of your guilt I will be the partner of your revenge Let us see what comes next this is from Mr Standfast Shall I read it
Charles assented by a nod and Figgins read thus
TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ
SIR
As you have made yourself the public talk of this kingdom as your father through you has
—What said Figgins—
destroyed himself
—Great God said Charles
and after a pause in which both lifted up their eyes and hands to heaven he went on
you will not wonder for the sake of my character that I have done with you Yet in consideration of my pains and care in your youth—which indeed I little thought would be so required—I will take this last opportunity to wring your heart for lenitives I find have spoilt you that you may if yet there remain in it a single spark of sensibility awake to a sense of your wickedness though complicated and atrocious as it is no hopes can be entertained of your repentance
Damnation said Figgins I have not common patience the people are all mad A man would swear we had began the moment we left London by robbing upon the high way and that as soon as we arrived in France we enrolled ourselves members of a banditti
Charles looked vacantly wretched and Figgins continued
But what will the task avail of setting the black catalogue—
Horrid black indeed said Figgins—
of your crimes before you I shall only feast your eyes on what has given you so much pleasure and thus the contemplation of those seducing facts may stimulate you to a commission of others if possible still more daring to shew that you know how to attain perfection in villany Nevertheless as your fathers bounty has so largely reached me in return for the unwearied pains I took to render you an accomplished and worthy member of society I will make this one effort towards your conversion
Charitable creature said Figgins Where has Mr Standfast picked up so much scrupulosity I thought his maxims were to allow a broad liberty of conscience Zounds one would think he had fallen in love with Mrs OShocknesy But let us come to the catalogue
First then would not one think that you determined to set honesty honour and even decency at defiance to debase yourself whose character was really high in the worlds estimation and raise your brother who had so foolishly borne himself as to be indifferently thought of by that wanton unnecessary theft at Calais which your brother shocked at such conduct so handsomely repaired
Well this is master stroke the first said Figgins Why at this rate Charles your fortune to be understood must like a witches spell be read backwards Poor Standfast I thought he knew mankind better
Next who will believe but the unmanly attack upon your brothers life at Lisle after introducing him into company to ridicule and exasperate him was concerted that you might become heir to your fathers title and fortune Indeed nothing can be so clear for in France the murder would have been considered as a rencounter and in England it would not have been punishable
Well argued Master Standfast said Figgins Why he is an altered man I am cursedly mistaken if he did not practise in his youth very nearly as bad actions as those of which he only accuses you and yet I believe this is the first time he ever preached upon such a subject
—This is deep laid villany indeed said Charles but go on Mr Figgins
As to your next material crime—for I shall pass over what may with propriety be pardonable on the score of youth and inexperience
—very civil upon my soul said Figgins—
what could induce you to do the very thing of all others which was most likely to incense Sir Sidney Roebuck
—Ay said Figgins what could that be—
to assist in stealing a nun from a convent
—Whew said Figgins What is our civility to honest Combrie so construed And yet damme if this same Mr Standfast did not steal a nun upon his own account in his youth and if report says true she broke her heart through his ill usage But against himself he would have you believe report tells lies Why then is it to be believed against his friend But one man may steal a horse—Never mind it Charles—you have been rascally treated indeed
To assist in stealing a nun from a convent must of course prove an immoveable bar to his farther favour Had not his own virtue resisted the same action in his youth the mother of Annette might have been now his wife for then perhaps she would not have pined herself to death for love of him in her retirement
Here I believe said Charles he speaks truth and had I been guilty of this crime Sir Sidney would never have pardoned it
But mark said Figgins what a curious gentleman Mr Stand fast is He takes a lie establishes it as a fact and then argues upon it as if it were truth But let us proceed Oh how a man might preach upon the folly and credulity of mankind and take his text from this letter
As to your stealing this ladys fortune it is certainly no more than a compound of the last crime but that does not lessen its magnitude—Thoughtless boy how could you have the bold audacity to set yourself against the jealous laws both civil and religious of such a kingdom as France In this business I find Mr Figgins chose to cut a great figure
—Oh I am glad to find I am brought in at last Indeed I cut as great a figure at one place as another except indeed the robbery at Calais which this villanous Charles Hazard chose to conceal even from me to preserve a false delicacy to a rascally brother who in return for saving him from the gallows has connived with his infernal mother to load him with unmerited infamy—
But I shall write to him upon the subject
And he will answer you Mr Standfast said Figgins
In the mean time I shall only say that your conduct was madness and your motive infamous for though what you did could not be wholly excused it might in some degree have admitted of palliation had you been actuated only by a disinterested generosity to your principal but stipulating for terms with him and receiving a part of the money as the price of your iniquity confirms the principles of villany in you so fully that volumes of the best precepts and ages of the best examples I fear could not reclaim you
Why no Mr Standfast cried Figgins I do not think they could for what signifies washing any thing white that is pure already Damned damned mischievious cat added Figgins and then went on
I hope you felt your loss of five hundred pounds at cards as a judgment on you
Well said exclaimed Figgins truly parsonic Mr Standfasts belief is like his barn it swallows any thing
The reflection that the man who plundered you is a proscribed character and murder his crime perhaps first induced your acquaintance and afterwards how could hearts so congenial avoid a society with each other—
This is saucily impudent indeed said Charles
Damnably so said Figgins and went on
—But let it mortify you to reflect that you were not to enjoy the fruits of your wickedness but that it was to be wrested from you by your superior in subtilty though not in crime for the purpose of squandering it upon your own harlot who nows revels with him and laughs at you and who such is the certain dependance of one bad character upon another robbed and deserted you at Lyons upon finding you committed to prison for murder
Why then said Figgins by Mr Standfasts confession I am a good character for I will never desert you But how did he discover this last business of Madame St Vivier for even I had not the heart to tell it you In short my friend she has lain her hands on every thing which is the more unlucky as these French counsellors will not—nor indeed will any others—plead without fees But let us finish this letter and talk of these matters afterwards
May you escape the punishment due to that crime and every other and live to merit by your contrition if not the praise yet the pity of all good men
The date of which charitable epoch I suppose Mr Standfast is to appoint said Figgins
Be assured that nothing but a confession of your crimes and a sincere repentance of them can restore you to the countenance though I am afraid nothing can to the hearts of your friends—But do not be so mistaken as to attempt a defence of your actions there are too many witnesses against you even your own servant whose whole life upon proof has been blameless shocked at so many repetitions of your unprincipled conduct has left you even without demanding his due lest he should be thought to have received though not guiltily the wages of iniquity
There is a precious rascal for you said Figgins I can only say for a man that pretends to know the world I never saw such a dupe as Mr Standfast in the whole course of my life
In short this is the sum of all Your father is dead you are—though he fell by his own hand—virtually his executioner your brother has take possession of the title and estate your mistress is promised to another and thanks to your own villany you have not a friend in the world May God turn your heart and make you more worthy the regard of others as well as
STEPHEN STANDFAST
CHAPTER VII
MORE LETTERS AND SOME HEROISM
WELL by heaven said Figgins as he folded up Mr Standfasts letter this is the most consummate piece of cruel treachery that surely ever was concerted I could gnaw my flesh And then this last business To practise on the inexperience of your mistress Damned mixture of stupid credulous folly and ignorant obstinate pride I suppose they intend to marry her to your brother
I believe they do not know themselves what they intend said Charles This I know that they have given me a very grounded though a very early conviction that there is not upon the face of nature so contemptible a being as a human creature and I am strongly convinced that should the event as to my present situation turn out favourably—which I am perfectly careless about—though I hope I shall love benevolence as much as ever I shall hereafter look with an eye of distrust on every man whom I have not proved yet not superficially but from that sort of thorough conviction which you have given me—to be my friend
I thank you sir said Figgins for a compliment which I hope I shall deserve But you will give me leave to say that I am astonished at the tranquillity with which you receive all these unmerited affronts I expected—though I rejoice to find it otherwise—that such a complication of invidious calumny would have almost turned your brain
—and in this Mr Figgins spoke truth for he did so expect—
and especially this last blow concerning your mistress
The very number and weight of these slanders said Charles are what makes me sit down perfectly easy under them I was in a flattering dream as to the world and fondly fancied myself in the midst of generous friends who till I left my native country were willing to give me credit for any little merit I possessed and anxiously studious to find a venial motive for any indiscretion But this present moment convinces me I was mistaken their discernment as to my real character was so shallow that it is plain they laid up every little trait of youthful folly to ground a falacious argument upon which they now believe to be solid reason This co-operating with the most unworthy and unheard of treachery they have given me up as a profligate and an abandoned character impossible to be reclaimed and this calumny from a quarter they all detest—which common reflection must call impossible and a lie—is cherished warmly zealously cherished to the utter reprobation of him for whom they pretend a friendship To whom then does the reprobation really belong Does it not recoil on themselves And what compliment should I pay myself by calling that man my friend who is so ready blindly ignorantly unfeelingly to think me the worst villain that ever infested the earth Perhaps they did not know that I do possess one quality in as strong but I hope as honest a degree at least as any of them If I do not flatter myself my pride is of the right sort and it shall not bend to the least explanation till I have received a concession from those who have injured me No no Figgins an emperor shall not trample upon me and by all that is sacred I will see contrition in my enemies before I deign to communicate with them
My noble friend cried Figgins
Let me finish said Charles As to Annette she is a beautiful girl and I love her better than any woman I ever saw or rather what I feel for her is more like love than I have felt for any other but I never could flatter myself we should ever be united there was always a something about my mind that forbade me to think of it As matters are I will forget her for though I am convinced this prohibition—so perverse is human nature—would soon were I to give way to it make a fool of me yet it shall not be for I will not love her dishonourably and as to marriage I do not love the world so well as to bring its cares upon my head
Figgins expressed more amazement at this calm easy resolute good sense as he was pleased to call it than at the rest and then they proceeded to a third letter which proved to be from Mr Gloss It contained these words
TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ
MY DEAR SIR
I must begin my letter in the true mercantile style by saying that my first twelve epistles not being honoured I send this my thirteenth &c &c
Jesting apart my good friend you are the strangest model of eccentricity that ever let inconsistency run away with reason
What schooled on all sides said Figgins
For my own part I neither see the satisfaction nor the good sense in suffering all your friends to write so repeatedly without deigning to answer their favours nor how a man can be so infatuatedly sunk in the delirium of idle pleasures—which are to be sure well enough in their season—as to neglect the much more important duties of friendship and relative affection
I need not tell you for you must have received them that nearly thirty letters from your father and others have been sent you
These are some of them I suppose said Figgins
At present indeed answers would be of little avail for your father has shot himself
—Delicately announced said Figgins—
and all your friends have turned their backs upon you yet on the score of the many shining qualities you certainly possess those engaging manners those bewitching attractions and that dawning reason which was for your years so decisive and manly you may command my friendship as far as one gentleman ought to assist another—
On the score of all these considerations said Figgins you had better upon my soul Mr Gloss let him command your polite and therefore unmeaning friendship on the score that is between you and then he would receive about three hundred pounds which you borrowed of him in driblets But let us see further
—Though I greatly fear even my influence with Sir Sidney—for he does me justice—cannot restore you to his good opinion
His influence said Charles
However as I mean to vote with him in parliament—for you know I told you some time ago by letter that I was returned for the borough of Bray—
The devil you were cried Figgins
you may be assured I shall willingly embrace every honourable opportunity of offering you my service You know my candour and my consideration for my friends The first induces me to tell you without hesitation that the baronet has promised me his lovely daughter
So so said Figgins
and the latter that I could not be prevailed upon to accede to otherwise so desirable a proposal till he assured me in so many words he would never speak to you again
Which said Figgins you very probably requested as a favour
Pray write to me and if there be any thing I can with propriety do to serve you either with government or privately you may in all worthy matters command
My dear Sir
Your truly devoted servant GEORGE GLOSS
Here is another precious member of the human community said Charles
Sir said Figgins what I have heard and seen to-day baffles my whole experience and for the future I will not believe that because I see a man do a good or a sensible thing that he will not do a wicked or a stupid one but on the contrary expect to see him turn about and exhibit that various pitiable contemptible figure that the best and the wisest I find are too apt to represent
To be sure there is one thing in their favour Nobody has it is plain received any letters from you
But good God said Charles is it not very plain to be seen how all this has come about Has not the very rascal prevented it who has gone over to bear false witness against me
True cried Figgins and then which way shall we reconcile to the wisdom of Mr Standfast or the goodness of Sir Sidney so hasty a belief of such slander against one of whom it has been their pride to have had such a good opinion
If their conduct be goodness and wisdom said Charles it is both superficial and supererogate There is not common sense in it and I am sure there is not common good manners for what virtue is that which condemns unheard—and what modesty that has the presumption to punish without the right What are my actions after all to these people Am I dependant on them No I thank God I am not nor will I ever call one of them my friend nay nor any man upon earth who shall be bold enough to scrutinize my intentions No my will my desires my conduct shall be my own and if I cannot make friendship upon any other terms I would rather be alone in the world with integrity of heart than give colour by my intimacy to their suspicions who have dared to think me a villain
Admirably reasoned my friend said Figgins and I am sorry for their sakes to say too justly—But let us see this other letter which bears the same date with the rest
TO CHARLES HAZARD ESQ
SIR
I know not in this hurry of my spirits if there be any precedents in books of a womans writing to a man out of mere friendship at least of sufficient authenticity to warrant my disregarding decorum in this manner If there are not it is a new incident and I must rely on the purity of my intentions to excuse it
So extremely like a fairy tale where the heros bad genius only makes its appearance is all that has happened in this family relative to you that if I did not fancy I had myself sagacity enough to account for the influence of the foul fiend and whence it originates I should think it very hard indeed that people could not be contented with losing their own senses but they must insist that others lay aside theirs
That I may hasten through this epistle sir—for I have a good deal to say—I am willing unfashionable as it may be at our house to do you poetical justice not however in the style of your good friends here who finding you in danger of your life think—in imitation of ARISTOTLE RICHARDSON and the barbers uncle in
Gil Blas—
that they cannot excite in you too much terror
This candour in me does not proceed from any weak compassion but from a fair revisal of your actions at the time they passed under my observation and I do not think that charity authorises me to look farther at least with a severe eye
Abiding by this mode of decision common justice obliges me to say that all your mad freaks here which I would not have given a farthing for you if you had been without originated from worthy motives Musquito Ego and even Toogood smarted it is true but they highly merited their punishment and the lash was held by the hand of justice but think ye they forgot it in your absence Oh no scurvy fellows as they are Thank heaven however the worst of your enemies cannot give a bad motive to your conduct in a certain instance Yet there are some who compare you to Lovelace and call your treatment of Jude
sparing your rosebud
—charming young man as you were and I will believe
are
Judy daily blesses you poor girl and joins with me to pray for the hard hearts that are set against you Your behaviour as to her began continued and ended critically right and her virtue as it ought was rewarded in the catastrophe nor can a soul capable of such an act indulge a single principle that could dictate such dreadful crimes as we are all commanded to believe against you
As for my part I have read so much that human nature is a thing I am pretty well versed in I must beg leave therefore to use my own proper intellects rather than those of others for though I am devoted to Sir Sidney yet I am more so to truth and honour and these wih not let me see why nature should perform a miracle by turning all those excellent gifts she had afforded you into diabolical ones merely for the gratification of your enemies and commiting a breach of promise which she was never known in any other instance to do
Your father was certainly greatly shocked at not hearing from you but if we do not admit all the rest why should we not charitably believe your letters have been intercepted For my part I should think if you had committed all this wickedness you would the sooner have written to him if it had been only for the sake of colouring it But poor man his behaviour was very strange towards the last yet you will find he could not bear to curtail you in your circumstances
As to the state of our family it is briefly as follows Sir Sidney will not hear a word in your favour from any body my dear lady you know is the mirror of duty and goodness and therefore if she have any sentiments to your advantage she dare not divulge them even to me charming Annette who—or our complicated history will be incomplete—must marry you at last is grown an angel and I scruple not to tell you will never love any body but yourself but dear creature devoted to her duty how will she dare to look a stern father in the face much less disobey him and unfortunately she is not Lady Roebucks child
I have not mentioned to you however all our family Mr Gloss I can assure you is no very inconsiderable member of it He has so pushed himself among the great that he is in parliament and he has so attached himself to Sir Sidney that he is become his darling He has certainly a knowledge of human nature but it is an artful one for I can see plainly he has got round the good gentleman by praising his ancestry which we all know is his foible They have agreed together on making some motion relative to the antiquities of English baronets then he has introduced a number of improvements at Castlewick and put the people in a way of carrying the goods to market upon much better terms than they were used to which is all very good if his motives were so he has also been indefatigable in seconding Sir Sidneys designs at Little Hockley but how that will be now I do not know for your brother is beginning to settle grooms and others of his sporting followers there
Mr Gloss finding my partiality to books thought he knew where to find me vulnerable but all his erudition was not able to cover his designs which I could not however come into for my studies have never been subtilty but nature As to my sweet Miss Annette he was there entirely at a loss for she has no foible
Thus you see you have no friend but me except Mr Figgins who if the current account is to be credited is almost—for nobody it seems can be quite—as bad as yourself
Fear not however but some good will work out of this I shall be upon my guard and I am very much mistaken if I do not know of whom to be watchful I only remark at present that as it was said of ALEXANDER the best trait in his fortune was the choice of his tutor so I most sincerely believe that you would at this moment have been thought immaculate if the same could be said with the same truth of yours
I am sir Your very sincere friend EMMA DISTICH
P S I have this moment heard that your brother is to be married in a few days and that Mrs OShocknesy who assumes the title of Lady Dowager Hazard is coming to live with the happy pair
This girl said Figgins with her whimsical style has more good sense than all of them put together Her reading has been like the progress of a bee she has selected all the sweets and left the poison behind and it proves that her intellects are remarkably strong for she seems to have gathered as much mundaine knowledge by inference as others from worldly commerce and this is well exemplified in her being too cunning for Mr Gloss who indeed seems to be the director of this plot I wonder upon what terms he and the Lady Dowager are
She is a very good girl said Charles and I am afraid her solicitude for me will deprive her of her place
I fear so too said Figgins for she does not disguise that she dislikes Gloss who will take advantage of her being upon a false scent to get rid of her for her suspicions of Mr Standfast notwithstanding his scandalous letter are surely ill grounded This will be found out and she will be turned away as a mischief-maker But for this mistake the remarks in her letter would have been very shrewd and sensible but her dislike to Standfast is of ancient date He made pretty brisk love to her when he was in the family of Major Malplaquet and upon her resisting his inclinations he did not place in her virtue that implicit belief that it merited
I should think that would inspire her contempt said Charles rather than her revenge However I cannot help thinking as you do that Mr Standfast has given no assistance to this scandal but his belief of its truth which cannot have failed to lend weight and consequence to the opinions of the rest both in regard to their conviction that he is a judge of mankind and that he must know me better than any body It only turns out that he does not know me at all nay that I did not know him for I could not have thought it possible he could so soon nor with so much indifference have dropt the mask of the kind friendly adviser to betray the insolent assuming pedagogue
My dear sir said Figgins you will please to recoliect that Mr Standfast gets in years which will not lessen his pride of which he has possessed a pretty liberal quantity all his life and you may be assured it is not diminished by a recollection that he has a good five hundred a year settled on him for life which he ought by the bye to have the gratitude to remember belongs in right to you My two hundred a year comes from the same source and as we deprive you between us of a large unnual sum it is but common decency that we should shew a wish even though we have not ability to deserve it
Well said Charles God knows how long I am to live but that I may not pass my life in an eternal warfare I will not investigate any thing Time shall do it for me There is but one inducement to my giving the matter a single thought which is the situation of Annette However all I can do actively in relation to her will not only operate more to her disadvantage but plunge me into real wretchedness which is a thing I thank them all full unpleasant enough when one only possesses it in imagination When my mind is more at ease I may perhaps answer Emmas letter but it will be only strenuously to request she will not concern herself in my affairs at all and to make the poor creature easy by telling her that I can smile with contempt on all the malice of my enemies
And yet said Figgins I cannot methinks help wishing you would answer all the letters in the terms they deserve
Mr Figgins interrupted Charles though if I know my heart I should detest myself could I indulge for two minutes together an unjust or an ungenerous resolution yet I am so well convinced that which I have at present made is founded on reason and propriety that I would lose my life rather than relinquish it No they shall seek me or they shall lose me Let them take their choice and if they do not care which it would surely be greatly beneath me not to be as indifferent as they are
A summons to dinner put an end to this long conversation after which Figgins left his friend in his miserable apartment to go and prepare the awful business of the next day He was no sooner gone than our hero began to pervade the contents of those letters which Figgins had brought him from the bankers First he selected those from his father which were filled with such tenderness such distress of heart such sensibility yet unmixed with a single reproach that all poor Charless fortitude was nearly exhausted He sighed wrung his hands and cried like a child which his gaoler—as he entered his apartment to examine if the rivets of his fetters were fast—mistaking for apprehension on account of his approaching trial begged he would make himself easy for he had nothing worse to apprehend than hanging
If this fate really awaits him the reader and I may hereafter make some enquiry concerning his behaviour for as we have already examined together his life and character that same behaviour and his last dying speech seems all that is wanting to wind up his story At present we are going into happier company and if it be objected against us that in so doing we are deserters to his cause under whose banner we have inlisted we must even excuse ourselves by saying that we are not the only friends who have left a hero in prison to go over to his enemies
CHAPTER VIII
A CLUE TO THE FOREGOING LABYRINTH
RETROSPECTION is a very good and a very necessary thing If ones actions appear worthy upon a review they will be a sort of security for the future if otherwise their deformity being an unpleasant object of contemplation we may perhaps wish to replace it with something of a more lovely appearance at least this will be the case with good minds Some men love singularity others ugliness and I sincerely believe it is in some mens nature to love wickedness and even wickedness in which no pleasure can be enjoyed but the mere exercise of it For my part however I shall not here treat of such innate undeducible affections but endeavour to give to a positive cause every little freak of fancy that the personages in this history chuse to occupy their attention with
A very extraordinary conduct has been lately observed to govern all the good people on this side of the water ever since the reader and I took leave of them in order to accompany our hero to France What appears least reconcileable to credibility is the alteration of Sir Sidney who being a man of reason of the world of experience of consideration and of uncommon benevolence one would naturally suppose must in a most extraordinary manner have been tampered with before he could have been induced to give up a young man in whose dawnings of maturity he had taken abundant pleasure whose father he had loved and honoured and of whose happiness he had hoped to have been the guardian
Indeed when our hero left England Sir Sidney contemplated with great pleasure when he should return in the bloom of manhood with all those confirmed accomplishments so consonant to his rank and talents the reasonable delight with which he should witness an union between him and his daughter and as no one spoke of Charles but in a style of the most exalted panegyric no wonder if he was charmed at seeing every thing and every body confirm such honest and legitimate sentiments But when a week then a fortnight then a month then two then four elapsed without a single line from Charles to either his father his mistress or any other friend what could Sir Sidney think What judgment could he form of those reports which continually assailed his ears and which seemed gradually to turn all his friends against him
It may not be amiss to watch the progress of this business Zekiel as the reader was long ago informed when he left Eaton went to France There being in very straitened circumstances and totally under the direction of Mr Flush he was obliged to practise many tricks and shifts to get on especially as Kiddy who seems as a manooverer—his own word—to be a twin-born with Standfast very carefully threw certain gentlemen depredators in his way who are as every body knows pretty plentiful in France and who took care—his own language again—to keep the purse by sweating it in good running order
Being very closely driven at Calais and not having enough of Kiddy about him to distinguish between what the law calls theft from that which is so denominated by reason he did that through inexperience for which he
might
have been hanged when in fact his mode of policy should have made him do only that for which he
ought
to have been hanged
Mr Dessein however who had his policy too as we have seen did not chuse to expose him and by the advice of his principal he took care afterwards however he offended against justice in a religious sense not to sin against law
From a variety of sources which Flush contrived to get opened for him Mr Zekiel together with his own income and what he could drain from his mother and indeed from Mr Standfast contrived to cut a very capital dash at Paris He set very large sums
chez les comptesses
and he betted larger upon the course of Fontainebleau In short in spight of all he could amass together honestly or dishonestly he would have found himself not only aground but surrounded with some very marked disgrace if he had not met with a gentleman who was so kind as to administer very largely to his wants and who not contented with such liberal instances of kindness to a perfect stranger gave evident tokens of satisfaction when the young lord in expectation informed him he had a very tender affection for his sister
This gentleman the reader sees was Mr Tadpole He had it seems in company with the young lady we saw at Lisle who was to say truth not his sister—which circumstance indeed Mr Figginss sagacity taught us to suspect before—determined to make one bold push to render himself independant He had amassed at the gaming table in England about nine hundred pounds to which his reputed sister added thirteen hundred which she had won at a different game Their plan was to snap up some young man of good expectations first supplying him with money and afterwards with a wife
Tadpole who was originally a lawyers clerk carefully secured every step he took and by the time he reached England had Zekiel so completely in his power that being then of age he scrupled not to make over to his friend the reversion of a part of his fathers terra firma
Coming so unexpectedly to his title and fortune advantage was taken of this power over him and a marriage suddenly clapt up not out of fear of any reluctance in the young lord but lest an old lady one Mrs OShocknesy should not only destroy the hopes of the young lady by the exercise of her power over him but also those of the gentleman by furnishing him with the money to pay off the mortgage
This marriage which Emma gave us a hint of operated as we shall hereafter have occasion to notice in a most extraordinary manner but the business at present being to account for the reports against our hero I shall go back to Lisle where the reader will recollect I entreated his particular attention to all that passed
Our hero had never seen Flush and the two brothers were so grown out of each others remembrance that it is not wonderful they should remain in mutual ignorance till an accident unravelled the mystery After Zekiel had retired vowing revenge and left his brother master of the field of battle Kiddy as we have seen told him that revenge was very easily in his power He then informed him of Madame St Viviers intention to complete the happiness of Charles that evening and shewed him a chamber which he said and believed was hers Zekiel following the direction of his trusty valet was admitted to Kittys bed room and in the full belief that he was deceiving his brother made as happy as he could wish
The question here is how came Flush who was just arrived to know so well all these private matters The answer is by Mrs Kitty who together with her mistress had been as well instructed upon this occasion by Mrs OShocknesy as Miss Snaffle had upon a former one
Flush having the honour to know both the ladies did not scruple when the squabble began between our hero and his brother to interrogate the waiting maid as to
how the cat jumped
as he called it and having learnt from her the particulars of the assignation proposed to put Zekiel in the place of Charles which she promised without intention to perform for she knew if it were detected all their other designs on our hero would be at an end and at the same time she feared a discovery from Flush for indeed he menaced it if she refused She therefore directed him to conduct Zekiel to her bed chamber where he passed the night and the person who tapped at the door was Mr Tadpole who having first knocked at his
soidisante
sisters thought he had mistaken the room and afterwards went to his own bed for fear of further mistakes
So completely however were all these cross purposes acted that Kitty believed the person who knocked at the door to be no other than Mr Figgins who in his turn as has been shewn was otherwise employed Kitty however having given Madame St Vivier a hint of this business she burnt a light in her chamber by which means Charles came as he informed Figgins at the certainty of his not being mistaken
The most awkward circumstance in this affair was the scene which passed the next day in the post chaise between Zekiel and his two companions—Tadpole had taxed the young lady in the morning as to what person was in her bed chamber she assured him it was the young lord they were therefore astonished that he himself dropt no hint of it while on his side he trembled for fear any one should have maliciously discovered to them what he thought had really happened
This doubtful taciturnity gave Tadpole a notion that he was inwardly hugging himself at his success and that probably having stolen the possession of the young lady he might for some reason or other slacken in his devoirs for the future Miss also had suspicions akin to these and she had once an idea of throwing herself at her brothers feet and making use of this opportunity through his authority of exacting from Zekiel a written promise of marriage She refrained however and it was well she did Tadpole ventured a few hints He said he believed the devil had been let loose the night before in the inn for he had heard such running about and knocking at doors that he could not get a wink of sleep Zekiel blundered out an awkward remark or two Miss ventured at a few leading questions and in short they were all three on the verge of a discovery which would probably have overturned their respective intentions
It happened however that but one discovery came of it and that was confined to the knowledge of Tadpole and the young lady It was that somebody had been in bed with Miss which somebody was neither Zekiel nor Tadpole They therefore for they had not an idea of Figgins concluded it to be Charles and this thought dwelling in their imagination presented itself as a bar to their scheme Upon a consultation on this subject afterwards however they resolved it should make no difference as to their future measures and their minds being thus made up—which the reader will allow to be a pretty strong instance of delicacy—all matters went in their former channel
When they came to England it was agreed on all hands that Mrs OShocknesy and Standfast should know no more of Mr and Miss Tadpole than if there had been no such persons in the world
And now came as Figgins called it masterstroke the first This gentleman corresponded with Mr Standfast as did also Madame St Vivier whose real name was Jenny Singleton with Mrs OShocknesy From their accounts they had began to frame an accusation which the arrival of Zekiel greatly improved and which with its amendments stood as in Standfasts letter
These tidings were conveyed to Mr Gloss who insinuated them into Sir Sidneys family as opportunity served and as fast as one rumour died away he broached another that the good baronet might not be suffered to cool
In this worthy business he found three very useful tools in Musquito Ego and Toogood who remembering as Emma has told us their old grudge—especially when revived in its worst lights by Gloss—were continually throwing out some hint to Charless disadvantage Musquito said the young fellow was mad and because he had been tolerably educated and puffed up with false applause had like other spoilt children thought he could carry all the world before him Toogood said that he could not have believed a young man of such promising parts would so disgrace all his friends while Ego declared that if he had been a young fellow blest with so many advantages he would have turned out the best creature in the world In short Gloss made them play fast and loose as he pleased and when they talked in exaggerating terms of his former pranks he once ventured in a mild way to reprobate the part Sir Sidney had taken in the business of Swash and the taylor saying he should not wonder to hear his acquiescence upon that occasion quoted as an excuse for the wretchs enormities
These measures together with the interception of Charless letters which by the bye furnished Standfast who received them with a most admirable guide to the execution of his schemes and now and then some cursory intelligence from genglemen just arrived from France who saw our hero drunk at an inn or quarrelling in a coffee-house where he refused notwithstanding their earnest solicitation to send any letter or message to England All these I say worked his utter ruin in the opinion of his friends and yet I must do Sir Sidney the justice to say he hesitated against what appeared to be positive conviction till one morning news was brought that Lord Hazard was found shot through the head and that the act was certainly committed by himself for one pistol lay close by him and another was found loaded in his pocket and they were the same pair he had bought when he was last in town
Two days after this melancholy accident John arrived who wept over his old masters corpse said he did not wonder at what had happened afterwards corroborated all that had been reported did not spare Figgins and concluded with an account of Charless being imprisoned at Lyons for murder producing at the same time a French Gazette which gave the particulars of the whole transaction Under these appearances with Gloss at his elbow Sir Sidney wrote the letter we have seen
CHAPTER IX
CONTAINING A RECEIPT TO FORM A GREAT MAN—A VERY CURIOUS INSTANCE OF FILIAL PIETY AND ANOTHER OF MATRIMONIAL COMFORT
HAVING formerly hinted that Mr Gloss was selected by Standfast as a husband for Annette and again in the last chapter shewn that these two gentlemen acted in concert in a fraud of no less consequence than what SHAKESPEARE who well knew human nature calls the worst of injuries—the taking away a mans good name—I feel it incumbent on me to account for the close intimacy which certainly did subsist between them
When Gloss came to England from Madeira either accident or necessity or something—for it is not necessary now to be particular—pointed out Mr Standfast as a proper person to assist him in his views of settling in this country
That reverend gentleman ever ready to help out a genius—for this quality must be allowed to Mr Gloss—advised him to trump up a story of going to the Cape of Good Hope and then return after going only to Madeira where he actually had yet some little business and circulate a report that he had touched his fathers fortune which being in merchandise he had only to change it into money to cut a figure
Being introduced to a number of tradesmen as a young nabob he presently sat himself down in a most elegant house built a
vis a vis
and took up large quantities of goods Standfast supplying him with what ready money he was in absolute necessity of
Cutting this figure and having his pretensions backed by Standfast money was next borrowed Snaffle and Dogbolt becoming occasionally collateral securities and this trade went on so swimmingly that in less than a year and a half they found their names standing out on different engagements for upwards of twenty-seven thousand pounds twelve at least of which Standfast had converted to his own proper use for the avarice of Mrs OShocknesy was insatiable and the poor gentleman doated on her to a degree of infatuation
Thus situated their ruin collectively was inevitable if they could not stem this storm which now seemed to be bursting over their heads The difficulty seemed to be how to manage it but to such geniuses all dangers were surmountable Some hundreds were laid out in India goods to shew by way of sample which were bought for exportation to save the drawback and afterwards clandestinely relanded
Every possible exertion was made to give responsibility and consequence to the appearance of Mr Gloss A large estate was bargained for nay he even went so far as to wait on the minister to offer an exclusive treaty for a loan Thus his name rang in the newspapers and the whole world believing him to be in possession of an immense fortune offered him any assistance he might think proper to command Large sums were soon pressed upon him which went to satisfy such as would not shift the responsibility from his confederates shoulders to his Others did not make any difficulty of doing this so that after a variety of negociations Mr Glosss name stood alone for the original sum of twenty-seven thousand pounds and seven added to it
What was the next step How was he to go on How skreen himself from his creditors How indeed but by borrowing the writings of a friends estate and standing for a borough He had given proofs of his abilities as a negociator nobody knew the theory of commerce better who then so proper to fill an office under the state
He had fixed his eye on the treasury ship of the navy and I have said he had a knock of getting to any spot that he fixed his attention on A public acknowledgment that he was determined upon having this post that is to say whenever there should be a ministry virtuous enough for him to mix with gained him his election
His speech from the hustings was very original and therefore very taking In all addresses he had hitherto noticed there were a number of general promises which were never performed He on the contrary resolved to promise nothing but what his constituents were sure he would perform if he could
He began with saying that he had an interest in offering himself for that borough and so had every man living when he made a similar application for would any one present or in the world exercise his talents for nothing This he said was honest and therefore he had no doubt it would be popular He went on with saying he had watched with great attention the unhappy situation of this country and was ready to lend a helping hand to save it from impending ruin For this however he certainly expected a reward and it was but just Would a physician save a life without a fee—or a parson a soul without his tithes It was folly it was nonsense it was hypocrisy for men to pretend disinterestedness and mere love of their country He loved his country as well as any body was as disinterested as any body but still patriotism and self-denial could not imply in the present instance more than this that while loaves and fishes are going forward a man should eat only to satisfy nature instead of guttling till he furfeited himself
He said he would be plain and fairly lay open all his views The navy of this nation was its bulwark its glory It was that which lent millions to our treasury magnificence to our appearance and terror to our name It was that which made us respected and admired dreaded and envied We made but a point on the face of the globe but yet that point though small was resplendant It was gazed at with wonder by the remotest corners of the earth We were the true Cynosure of trade the commercial pole that with more than magnetic force attracted the interests of surrounding nations All this was owing to our navy the protection of our commerce His ambition therefore was to be treasurer of that navy in the execution of which office though he expected to be paid for his trouble yet he would be bold to say his conduct would deserve it for he was sure he should save immense sums to the nation
He said he despised professions They were unmanly ungenerous and an insult to those to whom they were made he had therefore honestly opened his mind That honesty would he doubted not be a sufficient security with Englishmen whose natural character was honesty for his future good intentions If he should have the great honour to be returned for the borough of Bray and a minister should come in of sufficient ability and integrity for him to act with he would stipulate for the situation he had set his heart upon and they would then see how the money would be handled He would be bold to say though it would be for his interest it should also be for theirs for the interests of the member and his constituents were inseperable
He finished his speech with saying he scorned to appeal to their ears he hoped he had appealed to their hearts and as their own conviction must teach them that truth and only truth had been his guide he hoped that honesty plain dealing and unreserved candor would mark that day as an epoch when a member of parliament was chosen who had no expectations but from honour no views but from sentiment
I need not add that Mr Gloss carried his election for notwithstanding this florid speech which was indeed novel enough he had bought the borough and the gentleman who contested the election was only a nominal antagonist set up to save appearances
This point being carried the person of Mr Gloss was sacred and his creditors might go whoop for their money Exasperated with this treatment his
vis a vis
was stopt in the street and executions served in his house But this was as useless as the rest all his property was made over to Mr Standfast for money lent And now we see Mr Gloss without an inch of land he could call his own nearly forty thousand pounds in debt with a house and an equipage made over for safety to another a parliament man a popular speaker almost the leader of a party and making large strides with the principles we have seen towards a responsible and lucrative place under government for the treasurership of the navy he was determined to have
As he really began to boast and not without reason of his influence he thought he could not attack Sir Sidney in a more vulnerable place than his ancient house which from a long train of collateral argument he proved to be older than the baronet himself had suspected
I shall not go into the minutiae of this arrangement which must not only be dry but uninteresting to the reader who I dare say would bate a little in the article of birth to such as made up the deficiency in honour—but only say that Mr Gloss made it out very clearly that Sir Sidney was the only living issue of the family who held the honour of the first English baronetcy and offered to make a motion in the house which he should support with many powerful arguments that his majesty be advised to grant to Sir Sidney Walter Roebuck and his heirs for ever an exclusive patent of baronetcy under the title of baronet in chief to be considered as an honour between that of a common baronet and a baron in like manner as a marquis is considered between an earl and a duke and the precedent to be quoted as an illustration of the argument was to be that as there was but one real marquis—which was the case at that time—so there should be but one chief baronet
The baronet certainly listened to the proposal and turned it a good deal in his mind and though he doubted whether he should avail himself of such an opportunity of aggrandizing his family—especially as he had no son—yet as he could see nothing but attention to his interest in the conduct of Gloss he certainly conceived from that moment a great regard for him This was prodigiously augmented by the attention this last mentioned gentleman paid to Castlewick and the actual advantage its interests received from his advice which both gave the baronet an insight into his capacity and confirmed his good opinion of it All these circumstances co-operating as indeed Emma has already told us no wonder if he had familiar entrance to his house afterwards to his heart and at length an offer of his alliance
Mr Gloss took care also to appear the friend of Charles but then his mediation never came without an insinuation that he was more a friend to honour In short the two characters were so strikingly contrasted in the mind of the baronet that without any great stretch of propriety the reader must allow under these circumstances that it is not to be wondered he should turn about in the manner I have described Besides—for I would fain sum up every trifling figure to make the aggregate of my reasons upon so important a point convincing—Sir Sidney felt a delicate a nice repugnance perhaps too much so at the idea of a connection with the son of a man who had destroyed himself and who had assuredly borne in his youth a very bad character
Again he plainly foresaw that all his benevolent attempts at Little Hockley would soon be frustrated by the innovations of the young lord for it was not yet so firmly rooted but that owing to a new crew of revellers it began already to lose ground This and the recollection of the ancient feuds which he now feared would be renewed heartily conquered his inclination to be in any respect allied to the family of Lord Hazard though he admired the talents of our hero and really had such a value for him as to wish his welfare though he doubted whether he would ever deserve it
Mr Standfast and Mrs OShocknesy must now become a little the subject of our attention That gentleman and lady had been sometime married but it was the wish of both that it should not be published She brought with her a comfortable number of debts and being now a
femme couverte
very soon contracted a number more In short there were no bounds to her extravagance which Mr Standsast seemed as anxious to feed as she to indulge—His own income including a living the gift of my lord his annuity from that nobleman the interest of his legacy from Major Malplaquet and what he had besides been able to realize—for no object upon earth except Mrs OShocknesy had been sixpence expence to him—was about seventeen hundred a year the lady had three yet we have lately seen above twelve thousand added to their income in a year and a half But what was this He doated on her as implicitly as rapturously and as boyishly as Barn well did on Millwood and threw large sums into her lap as willingly whenever he could steal them for I think the means he used to get at them might very well be called theft On her side no dutchess must dare to vie with her in taste and expence But every source from whence this profusion was supplied at length dried up Mr Gloss being in parliament nobody would trust him and thus the whole credit of the confederacy was at a stand Besides Lord Hazard who was expected to grieve himself to death for the loss of his wife and the irregularities of his son was yet alive and had no disorder but sorrow which though immoderate did not seem likely to kill him What joy then to the heart of this lady to hear he was no more—to find her son in full possession of more than thirteen thousand a year the whole of which she intended to command Her transport knew no bounds She bespoke a new carriage and new liveries and bowled down into Warwickshire in the most superb and magnificent style that money could procure or fashion invent taking with her such domestics for her son as she conceived proper for his situation in life In short nothing could equal the triumph with which she thought herself sure of taking possession of both her sons senses and his affairs Judge then what was her astonishment when flying to his arms he stopt her by introducing his wife being no other than the very Miss Tadpole that Figgins to use his own words dubbed him with by anticipation at Lisle What then did she feel Words are not strong enough to describe her sensations It took her breath away She raved stampt laughed execrated and would probably have died with the violence of her passion had not a shower of tears borne away the first torrent of that complication of distressful feelings which assailed her At length she accomplished something like articulate utterance when the whole school of Billingsgate had it been present might have heard and edified No opprobrious name that could be scandalously spoken or maliciously applied was unremembered His lordship—surely no lord was ever so called before—was a pitiful rascal a nincompoop a hop o my thumb a paltry puppy and a pimping scoundrel The lady was a scurvy jade a fortune hunting minx a low wretch and a sorry trull
Zekiel laughed at all the abuse on himself but taking fire at the insults offered to his wife cried
Ill tell you what it is maam I know you see what youd be at but damme let me tell you damme that I am out of my leading strings damme if I ent and I wont no longer be schooled dye see by any old cat in England
Old cat screamed out the lady dowager
The young lady here interfered and begged her husband to consider he was talking to his mother—
To my mother cried he why so I know I am and a pretty mother she is now is not she to abuse you and I in this here manner Why I knowd what she was upon she thought to come here and be lady paramount of every thing and snub and ding me about like a lout and a school boy but damme if Ill have any such doings no I wont old gentlewoman Ill assure you I know in a week if she was to be here shed be whole and fole nay I should not wonder if she wanted at last to take my seat from me in the house of lords But hold now I think ont she has been there once too often already
You brute exclaimed his mother You wretch—you undutiful cursed devil Oh I could tear your eyes out
I dare say you could cried the young lord but Ill tell you what mother if I am so undutiful you had better go away from such a cursed devil for to tell you the truth I never intended you should live with my wife seeing as how it was not unlikely you would advise her to play me a trick or so with my
valet de chambre

Mrs OShocknesy could contain herself no longer she ran to his sword and drawing it half way out of the scabbard swore she would murder him Lady Hazard here screamed so loud that Tadpole who had been walking in the garden came to their assistance and demanded what was the matter
The matter cried Zekiel only my old mother wants so send me post to the other world because I reminded her a little of the follies of her youth God bless the good gentlewoman added he do now pray go home wash the paint off your saded jaws and chuckle to old Standfast—Why do you think I have not been up to all the rum gig Why yes I have but it was no business of mine you know while I could coax you out of the ready Now dye see I can supply myself and thanks to nobody—so every one for himself and God for us all Mr Standfast has two or three goodish things they may keep you snug enough if you have a mind to live pretty and decent as an old gentlewoman ought As for me I intend to live nobly and spend my money like a man
But still my lord said Tadpole—
Brother Tadpole interrupted Zekiel Ill be damned if I live in the same house with a wife and a mother and theres it dye see That being the maxim of the thing you had better old lady as I said before go back again and it may be as well for you to keep a quiet tongue and advise Master Standfast to do the same or it may be the worse for both you dye see and the rum duke too
I have neither time nor inclination nor indeed capacity to paint the fury of the lady at her leaving the house which she did soon after Every bitter wish her invention could supply was lavished on her son Among the rest I think she said she hoped to her soul he would be both a beggar and a cuckold
The ladys return to Mr Standfast who was prevented by business from accompanying her into the country was truly a curious one She blamed him for every thing which was her usual method whenever any thing miscarried and he as usual bore his jobation with astonishing coolness This provoked her her passion then provoked him one epithet begat another till he was all the old sapless doting idiots that her fertile fancy could invent and she was by his account the damnedest infernal hell-cat that ever was born to curse an unhappy rascal like him
From storming they went to upbraiding then they proceeded to the situation of their affairs which were found to be plunged over head and ears in difficulties This in spight of them brought on reflexion and that upbraided them with the infamous practices they had been guilty of to serve an ungrateful wretch who after he had mounted to affluence by their means had kicked down the p
that raised him And here I cannot help remarking that the very devil for whom they had been so long toiling his ends accomplished spit in their faces and forsook them
CHAPTER X
IN WHICH MORE KNOTTY POINTS ARE CLEARED UP
THE reader will judge right if he fancies this reception of Mrs OShocknesy was a concerted thing between my lord and his brother in law who was now his steward as was Flush his butler Indeed as every servant formerly in the house was by this time replaced by others brought in at the instance of these two friends his lordship was doomed to be as much in leading strings as ever his mother could have held him for the life of her but as he was suffered in every thing to have his own way he did not concern himself with what they did privately but let them feather their nests in quiet under the idea of taking all his affairs off his hands because he was a man of rank in whom it was vulgar to let business interfere with pleasure
Mr Tadpole and Mr Kiddy understood one another very well for the latter had while they were in France made a discovery of which the reader shall some time hence participate
A secret to a minister of state or his type a great mans butler is a matter of some consequence—Here then Flush set up his rest It is true he balanced when he first came to England and was within a hairs breadth of destroying all Tadpoles hopes by making the above discovery to his old master Standfast but that gentleman making him some proposal or other that he did not like he retracted before he had so explained himself as to betray Tadpole and matters having since turned out so much to his advantage he thanked his stars that he had now sat himself down comfortably for life
Whether Kiddy was tired of his youthful follies or whether his whirligig inclinations had wearied themselves with turning round I know not but he seemed like a worn-out weathercock to be glad to rust where he had stopt and this choice was manifest in a total alteration in his manners He went to church nay more he was very often closeted with a methodist preacher with whom he got drunk and sang psalms
The young lord used to smoke this as he called it and gave him many a dry rub to one of which sallies he one day replied
Why Lord love your lordship my lord when you come to repent as I do of all your worldly gig and are down upon the heavenly comfort of a religious life you may tell the old rum codger with his hour glass come when he will you are up to all he knows and indifferent as some old learned gentleman says whether you close your peepers in sleep or in death
Emma who as she informed our hero was up on the watch no sooner heard of Kiddys conversion but knowing he must be full of good intelligence for her determined to tamper with him not that she had any expectation of finding him less a hypocrite in his new calling than in his old one She therefore saw there might be danger in putting her designs in execution personally In fact Emma saw herself of consequence in the very way she had all her life wished to be for she was convinced she should have it in her power in the language of those romances she so dearly loved to conduct two constant lovers to the temple of Felicity through all the briars and bogs that impeded their passage—Flush she pitched upon as the vehicle in this troublesome journey which Swash and his daughter were to guide while she herself like some tutelary genius should watch their motions inspire them with courage on the road and remove all difficulties in their passage to this desirable goal
In less figurative language she set Swash who with good reason loved Charles most sincerely to insinuate himself into Flushs good graces who I can tell you had already began to love homage so little had the spirit mended his humility
It was in the millers instructions never to mention a word of our hero or if he found that unavoidable to cover any suspicion of his friendship by railing against him but at the same time to cherish all that dropt from Flush—who now for distinction began to be called Canting Kiddy—that could in the remotest degree lead to any circumstance that implied a plot having been formed against him
As to Jude her part was a capital one and had she not been perfected in it by a very capable instructress she might have spoilt all
Kiddy it was notorious loved a pretty girl Judy was instructed to throw herself in his way to give an account of his behaviour and proceed step by step as she should be directed by Emma It was foreseen her virtue would be attacked but this was the very cunning of the scene Whenever this should happen to be the case she was directed to draw in her simple way a pathetic picture of the wickedness of mankind and lament the blindness of the world who could load the preserver of her innocence with unmerited reproaches while he who was seeking to destroy it had the character of sanctity and penitence They were not so mad however as to trust to Judys prudence alone nor her rhetoric for force might overcome both Swash therefore was to be at hand upon any trying occasion to rescue her which being romantic was still more to Emmas taste
If she should get at any material evidence her next step was to strengthen her own weak force by the alliance as she should think fit of either Mr Friend or Mr Balance or both and as she saw many obstacles would lie in the way particularly the business of Gloss she advised Annette to avow implicitly her affection for Charles which her father had formerly authorised and who would not so far contradict his own excellent character as to insist on her marrying one man before she had forgotten the other Besides Mr Gloss was not yet treasurer of the navy and therefore could not make those offers as to fortune which a man of Sir Sidneys rank and possessions would of course expect especially when he became chief baronet which circumstance ridiculous as it was really at times occupied his reflections for what man is there let him be ever so good or ever so wise but has his weak side
All this jumble or chaos of circumstances were fluctuating at this time in Emmas head out of which she had no doubt but she should form a world of happiness for the young couple
Matters being in this state as to our hero in England the reader and I will once more take a trip to the continent in which journey we cannot do better than follow the steps of Madame St Vivier and her handmaid Kitty whose private motives being made clearer—which seems very necessary—this history will stand as disentangled as any one could reasonably desire who wishes things to be brought forward in their natural order
It has been seen that I am not very fond of dwelling upon trifling circumstances I shall therefore without mentioning a word of these ladies bringing up say that Madame St Vivier was a fashionable woman of the town and that Miss Kitty though her handmaid had been in no less a sphere of life than herself Indeed but a very few years before she had cut a figure little less brilliant than Mrs OShocknesy but falling in love with either the beauty or the brogue of Mr Ireland she had really attached herself to him with a singular degree of constancy for a lady of her profession
When this gentleman was obliged to abscond in consequence of his duel he left his affairs in the hands of an intimate friend who thought proper to take no other notice of the trust than by appropriating every thing to his own use without remitting his friend abroad or allowing the lady at home a single sixpence so that in this case Kiddys remark of honour among thieves did not apply
Mrs Kitty having been sometime out of the way of practice—for fashion has as much to do in these cases as beauty—had recourse to her old friend Jenny Singleton who began just then also to be on the decline and proposed a visit to Sedan where Mr Ireland then was with a view to consult him on their future operations
This expedition was lucky enough for Mr Gloss coming across them they were tutored by Mrs OShocknesy how to make their journey worth while
Figgins gave them intelligence concerning the departure of Charles and as it had been concerted they met him at Dover
The ladies however determined to make all sure had privately agreed to act in the very manner Figgins has described for their experience gave them reason to believe that it was not impossible but Mr Ireland might forget to give them the meeting They therefore were in appearance to be alternately mistress and maid both to save expence to keep their secrets to themselves and also to avail themselves of any opportunity that might happen of snapping up any English booby by way of completing his tour for improvement
Matters turned out however very much to their satisfaction They met with Mr Ireland at Sedan he attended them to Nancy where as it has been seen he plundered our hero of a tolerable supply Nor did he absolutely part with them but hovered about as it were till his affairs called him into Italy to which place—after robbing our hero of every thing they could lay their hands on as we heard Figgins inform him—these two kind ladies followed him
CHAPTER XI
A JESUITICAL EXPLANATION—THE SEPARATION OF TWO FRIENDS—AND AN ANSWER TO EMMAS LETTER
IF the reader and I were unfeeling enough to leave Charles in such a situation that death seemed almost desirable to him Mr Figgins appears to have been more solicitous about him for in less than half an hour after the melancholy moment wherein I describe him reading his fathers letters he returned with great pleasure in his countenance took his friend by the hand and giving him joy told him he was liberated
Charles going from one extreme to the other was enraptured at the news and requested to be informed how so unexpected an event had been brought about Figgins answered him that they were in no place to satisfy his curiosity They were then joined by their attorney who had stayed behind to pay the fees of the prison and now the jailor who a little before had earnestly examined our heros chains to see if they were fast enough came with great ceremony to unfasten them
This and all other punctilios over they sallied forth and Charles and Figgins being arrived at their inn the latter thus accounted for his friends enlargement
Mr Figgins said that no single day had past since his friends imprisonment but some step had been taken to get at the truth of the unhappy business which had been the means of his suffering in so worthy a cause The accounts had been for a good while various and unsatisfactory and therefore he determined as he had enough in all conscience to vex him without being eternally tortured with such suspense not to say a word till some certain intelligence should arrive He said the first clue he had of any thing like a chance of success though he took no notice of it at the time was his friends saying he was sure he had somewhere seen the murderer This put it into his head—though he owned it was a conjecture greatly at random
But added he I would catch as much at a straw for my friends safety as my own That Ireland who was a great duellist was probably the man
And by heaven said Charles I do believe he was though it never struck me so till this moment
You shall hear said Figgins
I was inclined the more to believe this on hearing his name mentioned in an odd way by Madame St Vivier with whom I now began to think he had maintained some intelligence all along for I recollected that it dropt from her at Nancy that she had seen him in England This set me upon interrogating Kitty who confessed his having been at Lyons and that very probably he was the guilty person
I was now convinced they knew it Thinking therefore to practise the trick your brother taught us at Lisle I ordered John to enquire every day at the post-office and to bring me any letters directed to Madame St Vivier He I suppose made them acquainted with these instructions for after waiting till about three weeks ago to no purpose I was just thinking what other method I could hit upon when all on a sudden the ladies and Mr John decamped as I imagined together but we have since learnt he went to England
Women cannot so easily travel secretly in France as men I therefore soon found out their route which as I suspected led to where Mr Ireland was waiting for them My first intention was to have pursued them myself but reflecting I should be of more use to you upon the spot I got by the interference of our banker a very intelligent young man to go in my stead
The instructions given to this young man were not to act so as to endanger Mr Ireland—for that I knew you did not wish—but only to get from him such sort of satisfaction as should acquit you—The first part of this injunction was unnecessary for though he overtook the ladies in the kingdom of France the gentleman was safe in the confines of Savoy They however fearing for themselves served him as a guide and coming at length to where Mr Ireland had appointed them he did you ample justice making voluntary oath that you had no part in the fray but that of a mediator and that so far from having any malice you could not possibly know either the quarrel or its cause for that all you did was merely the effect of accident and entirely with a view to prevent mischief
This confession so sworn—which is now lodged to ground your discharge upon—he accompanied with this letter which you will find attributes the duel to the hastiness of the gentleman who unfortunately fell He talks of unhandsome reflections against Englishmen in general and him in particular In short be the cause of quarrel what it may he had it in his power to palliate the matter as he thought proper for there are no witnesses to contradict him
Thus added he my noble friend you are at liberty and I offer myself to avenge you on your enemies in any way you may think proper to point out for me
Charles thanked him heartily but said his only revenge would be contemptuous indifference
In some parts of this account Mr Figgins exceeded the truth and in others fell short of it He had not set John to enquire about letters he had not taken a hint from our hero as to Ireland he had not wormed the matter out of the ladies On the contrary a note had been received explanatory of Irelands flight on the very morning it happened and the intelligence had not been protracted out of tenderness to Charles but to cover the safety of the sugitive for though a gentleman was sent as our hero was informed and did actually return with the letter and oath already mentioned yet Madame St Vivier who to do her justice was as willing as any body to save Charles stipulated however that no arrangement should take place till Mr Ireland should be fully out of danger Then again there was no part of the conduct of these ladies unknown to him He knew why they went to Sedan he was accessary to the loss of the money at Nancy he even learnt that Kitty and Ireland were upon the best terms he consented when they went away to their taking that money of which he pretended to have been robbed and lastly so far from not being acquainted with Johns departure for England he sent him there and—not to hide the truth—with proper instructions how our hero should be written to so that he knew every word of Mr Standfasts letter before Charles received it
Mr Figgins now began to be very inquisitive as to our heros future plan Charles said he should immediately write to Mr Balance and if he found him willing to supply him without the ceremony of going to England he should continue his tour as he originally intended
for said he I see nothing in my native country that should make me desirous of returning to it
Nor I either said Figgins except it were to curse them all round
Pretty advice indeed said Charles with a laugh want a man deliberately to go seven hundred miles for no better purpose than to put himself in a passion
Well then may I be damned said Figgins if I think there is your fellow upon the face of the earth Such prudence and discernment at your age is truly astonishing
The reader sees that Figgins did not want Charles to go to England but as he well knew the right kind of argument to hold with mankind the stronger Charless obstinacy appeared the more he argued against it He shewed how easy it would be to undeceive Sir Sidney He painted the beauties of Annette the danger of losing her the triumph of obtaining her from his rival till at length being highly exhilirated with wine he had reason to repent of his warmth for Charles in the heat of his vivacity said something that implied a determination to return
Fortune however envious perhaps of his having so narrowly escaped an untimely end or thinking the hero of such a history as this had not been long enough upon his probation or bent upon bringing about his catastrophe whatever it be by the means of Mrs Emma her agent or for some other equally wise and considerate motive determined to give Charles good time to deliberate before he should come to any resolution for he was that night taken with a violent fever which lasting him several days without the smallest intermission and several weeks with but very little he was at length left in a most emaciated condition with all the symptoms of a gradual decline
The moment he was able he wrote to Mr Balance without however dropping a hint of his illness which precaution he enjoined Figgins also to observe thinking probably it would look like an overture to a reconciliation which had he even wished his pride would have forbid him to acknowledge
Indeed he was pretty resolute as to his future intentions for though his bodily strength was greatly impaired his mental faculties were at least as strong as ever
This was the only serious illness he had ever had in his life It had given him excellent time for reflection and the more he reflected the less he saw to be ashamed of In proportion therefore as he found himself wronged he persisted in his firm determination to consider himself independant and accountable to no man for his actions and as to enjoy the full possession of such principles he must not have many friendships he resolved to continue his tour that by gathering a plentiful stock of accomplishments he might be the better qualified to find a friend in himself
This scheme he was also determined to pursue after his own fancy which part he digested as deliberately as the rest Taking therefore an opportunity one day when the physician advised him to try the air of Montpelier he thus opened his mind to his friend Figgins
My dear sir it would be but a poor return to your warm and unshaken friendship merely to say it will ever be remembered by me with that sort of heart-felt pleasure every thing gives me that originates from such handsome and liberal principles It would however be taking a very unfriendly advantage of you if I could be so unreasonable as to requite so much generosity by suffering you to neglect and injure your affairs on my account
My father has settled on you an annuity to which is now annexed no conditions on your side of attention to me for he being dead his kindness must naturally be considered as a remembrance of past instead of a reward for present services but as I know your worthy heart will not let you regard yourself as entitled to this esteem unless you acquit your conscience of receiving it upon any other principle than that of desert instead of throwing away your time on me—time which at your season of life must be very precious to you and which you can without doubt employ to greater advantage in the bosom of your family and affairs—you shall keep a constant correspondence with me and I will promise to profit by that advantage as much as my capacity and abilities permit me so now do not take it unkind that I should have resolved to pursue my travels alone but rather let me have your excuse that I have already taken up so much of your time to your prejudice
It happened luckily for Mr Figgins that this was the very subject he had himself been two or three times on the point of broaching but he felt so awkward about it that he could not for the soul of him tell how to begin Having however the ice broken for him he did not scruple to acknowledge that his affairs at home were rather in a disordered condition and that he sincerely believed were he on the spot a certain bishop would at that time have an opportunity of promoting him but yet he could not think of leaving his dear his honoured friend it would look as if he was of a piece with the rest of the world and had basely deserted his cause
Your own heart and my experience of your generous friendship will my dear Figgins said Charles acquit you for after all what signifies what all the world says abroad when you have a cheerful monitor at home that approves your actions Beside in the opinion of those who take the freedom so very liberally to talk of me you will retrieve your character instead of injure it by quitting a man so unworthy to be spoken well of
Rather said Figgins if I am induced to leave you let it be with a view to confound any rascal who shall dare to use you ill Now I think of it you have need of a friend there to silence your calumniators and I assure you neither Mr Standfast whose friendship it is my intention to renounce Mr Gloss your brother nor even Sir Sidney shall dare to traduce your character with impunity
To which Charles said
Figgins if you would have me believe you value either my friendship or peace of mind imitate what I should do in the same situation When you hear any one vilify me laugh in his face without lifting him into consequence enough to think him worthy an answer
After a great deal of persuasion on one side and much apparent reluctance on the other it was agreed upon that our hero and Mr Figgins should part This they did with many warm protestations of friendship and future attention to each others interest—on one side I am sure very sincere—and a firm promise to keep up a regular correspondence
Not two days after the departure of Mr Figgins Charles wrote to Mr Balance by whom he had been treated as to his money in a very gentlemanly manner desiring without giving a single reason that he would immediately grant out of his fortune a hundred a year to Mr Figgins for life and about four hours after this letter was dispatched he received one from Emma informing him of his brothers actual marriage—and also that Lady Hazard was in a way to bless him with a son and heir—the discomfiture of the Lady Dowager the unaltered inflexibility of Sir Sidney the neutrality of Lady Roebuck the constancy of Annette a congratulation on his release which they had all heard from some spy in the camp to which she added pray God Mr Figgins prove not rather an Euristeus than a Pylades a gentle reproach for his silence an exhortation to return
but indeed said she to what purpose Justice come as amply as it may can now scarcely make you amends Of what use was the pyramid to Aesop after they had hurled him from the rock
—and lastly she informed him that she had a most formidable plot which had already taken root and when it should have grown blossomed and borne fruit she doubted not but she should gather a plentiful crop of justice to him credit to herself conviction to the abused and confusion to his enemies
Charles had not answered Emmas former letter it is true but he was determined now to do so once for all This was his letter
MY GOOD EMMA
Your attention to me to speak in your own way is a panegyric on yourself and a lampoon on those around you for even though I should deserve all they have so very liberally laid to my charge a little charity one should think would not do them any harm But I see the confederacy is strong and had I the shadow of a wish to break it up—which I really have not—it would I dare say be no easy matter
Your information as to your sweet young lady is very flattering and at any other time would have been very delightful but why should I pursue what I can never arrive at since the folly of her own family has made an union between us impracticable Be therefore good Emma—for upon my soul you are really a good creature—a friend to her and instead of filling her ears with imaginary happiness which she can never enjoy—recommend to her an observance of her duty by which she will no doubt more fully accomplish all her wishes You will the more readily induce her to this by assuring her which you may with great truth that whatever may have been my sentiments I am determined not to think of her in future—Indeed my intention and that for many reasons is never to see her again and without any ill compliment to your literary wisdom I must say you are a dunce if you do not see why
As to Sir Sidney and the rest of my formidable accusers I will not take the trouble to care what they think of me for though I heartily forgive them—though I think pity is the properer word—and would do them any service I honourably could—but I believe they think mine rather a shabby kind of honour—yet the world should not purchase from me a grain of friendship for them
And now Emma as you are so kind as not to think me quite the hang dog they have painted me do pray believe that what I have said above was dictated by sincerity and this admitted your understanding will tell you that I shall be insensible to all persuasion for you see by my deliberation that these resolutions are not the caprice of a moment Seeing this it will also strike you as repugnant both to your safety and my honour—which you know it would be a terrible thing not to redeem—to hold farther conference on the subject The same reasons will shew you the necessity of dropping your plot No my strange valuable kind girl keep the friendship of your patron keep your good opinion of me nevertheless and leave the rest to time who according to SHAKESAEARE—for you love a quotation—
tries all old offenders
and Time being a very just judge I shall never have any objection to appear before him
Adieu shew your wishes to oblige me by implicitly adhering to the contents of this letter
Your kind well-wisher CHARLES HAZARD
CHAPTER XII
CONTAINING AN EVENT WHICH HOWEVER SAGACIOUS THE READER MAY BE WILL NOT BE ANTICIPATED
CHARLES continued in a very weak state As soon therefore as he had received from Mr Balance such kind of authority as enabled him to find himself in cash travel where he might he complied with his physicians advice and removed by short stages to Montpelier with only a
valet de chambre
and a
laquais
both Frenchmen his intention being to shun the English as much as possible
His disorder for some time gave every appearance that if the malignity of his friends went so far as to wish him in the other world they would soon be satisfied Perhaps some of them might have been happy to have contemplated his situation—Their charitable expectations however would have been disappointed for his youth and constitution triumphed over the consumption and what perhaps was a greater victory over the united efforts of the physicians and at length—but not in less than seven months—his recovery was pronounced to be certain
I might here draw a striking picture enough of a young man of rank and fortune with excellent talents an admirable heart young handsome and sweet tempered without a single fault that might not be defended upon principles of reason hemmed in by an host of enemies and apparently dying by himself in a remote corner of a strange kingdom All this interspersed with apt observation and embellished with proper reflections would indeed make up good moral matter in this place and give me an opportunity of finishing the second volume with some very pretty round well-turned reading—but the business of this history is—as indeed I think every other ought to be—action which I give the reader warning will be more and more rapid as we go on I therefore beg that whoever shall wish I had paused at such and such a place and given my muse a bait cramming down every mouthful with a moral sentence will supply that sentence themselves which will be more than one advantage to me it will save me the trouble it will be more to the taste of every reader and it will give free scope to all those who think with me to go on without skipping
Charles did not want company at Montpelier for he did not want money He had officers and abbes out of number and sometimes ladies and now and then an English gentleman in misfortunes who was not the worse for his trouble in visiting him At other times he read the best authors and never lost any opportunity of speaking French which he at last accomplished correctly and elegantly
His health was re-established sooner than his strength On this account he slowly visited most of the towns in the south of France where he met with a variety of characters with whose histories were I so disposed I could interlard my book till as I once heard an Irishman say of a bad play the main plot would be all episode I shall however which is modest enough chuse but one and now we are talking of Irishmen it shall be a gentleman of that country he shall be a monk called Father Fitzgibbon and member of a convent of Benedictines
Our hero because perhaps he was in a wine country—for sick people are very whimsical—took it in his head to long for some beer an inclination however he did not seem likely to gratify for enquiry had been repeatedly made for that beverage to purpose His valet who had a most indulgent master—and they say a good master makes a good servant—determining not to give the matter up quietly procured intelligence that about two leagues off there was a convent of English Irish and Scotch where for their own use they brewed excellent beer To this convent without saying a word to Charles he posted Having told his story he received for answer that they brewed the beer for their own use as he had heard but nevertheless if upon paying them a visit they should like the gentleman they would supply him with as much as he could drink A card to this effect was dispatched inviting Charles to dine with them the next day He obeyed that summons and several others till what with the beer the good company and the ride which I believe had most merit—as the air in Wales performs that cure which the physicians attribute to the goats milk—in a short time he found himself in perfect health
I should not have mentioned this circumstance so minutely had I not designed to introduce Father Fitzgibbon who was superior of this convent to the reader and I should not have introduced Father Fitzgibbon to the reader if I had not had a material reason for it
This friar was as I have said a native of Ireland He was of a good family but being a younger brother he quitted Dublin and went to Bath—the usual market—in search of a fortune There he contrived to lodge in the same house where lodged also an ancient lady and her daughter the widow and heiress of an old hunks who had amassed a large fortune by boiling blubber at Deptford It was immaterial to him which he married but he was determined upon one of them and that one should be her who was richest This his intelligencers informed him was the daughter who being very ignorant and conceited and besides beset hard yielded upon easier terms than marriage which conditions the Irishman did not boggle about because for why said he
sure cant I make you very happy after I have ruined you for ever
The appointment being made when and where this forward young lady for the first time was to yield up the possession of her person to her intended husband Fitzgibbon which is not extraordinary in an Irishman made a blunder for mistaking his way instead of Misss room he got into her mammas who expected a gallant likewise
Before the morning they discovered their mutual mistake and before the next morning Fitgibbon prevailed on the old lady to rob the young lady of her fortune with which they set off for France and of which money three years after when this antiquated Venus died he had just enough left to purchase a commission in the Irish brigades To be brief After much riotous conduct and many misdemeanours he was broken when the church—which is in France something like what we say in England of the sea and the gallows—received him
He had been superior of this convent of Benedictines four years and at the end of three more he was to visit his own country for a twelvemonth when he assured our hero he would spend a month with him in England
For a few hours at a time of vacant hilarity Charles could not be in more agreeable company He laid himself out for their convenience sent them several desirable presents and left at his departure a handsome donation which Fitzgibbon did not scruple to tell him in a whisper should be laid out in excellent claret
Charles had stayed so long in France that the time was now nearly arrived which he had intended to have apportioned to his whole tour for his promise to his father had been to return in time to pass his birthday with him when he should have attained his one and twentieth year He therefore determined to go back to England in order to take his affairs into his own hands after which if he should feel himself so disposed he might then be in time to make his tour of Italy for so far from having any body to control him he did not think there were six persons upon the face of the earth who cared three-pence about him In this mind he set out with a view to stay a month at Paris and then jog on leisurely for England He arrived at Aix la Chapelle late in the evening where he supped and then ordered post horses to be ready the next morning The house seemed to be very full of guests and just as our hero got into bed they were reinforced by a company from the play Charles had been dropt asleep about an hour when he was all on a sudden awoke by a violent screaming For a moment—which is very natural in a strange bed—he knew not where he was Recollecting himself however he hurried on his breeches and slippers and throwing a morning gown over him took his sword and darted from his own chamber to that from whence the noise issued The door was locked but he burst it open with his foot and immediately saw a French officer struggling with a young lady who still shrieked with all her force With the hilt of his sword he struck the ravisher in a moment to the ground then placing himself between him and the young lady he stood ready for him in a posture of defence against he should attempt to rise At the moment he placed himself in this attitude rouse reader your whole attention—exert your whole stock of penetration—prepare for a most unlooked-for surprise—yet let it be ever so great it cannot be any thing equal to that of our hero when on looking towards the door he saw several persons enter the chamber and among the foremost Sir Sidney Lady Roebuck and Emma
Reader it was Annette herself whom Charles had rescued from a ravisher—who having in the fifteen months that he had been absent ripened into woman and improved in every limb and feature into more perfection than ever was described by the ablest pen or correctest pencil nay had the best poet or painter that ever wrote or drew seen her like our hero at that moment and even felt the same captivating sensation from the astonishing power of her irresistable charms then so greatly heightened still must a description of them have been incomplete for neither are there words nor colours strong enough for the task Charles though he had but a moment which was imperfectly lent him by the relative intelligence received from seeing who entered the room in that moment gazed away his soul his very brain received the whole force of her incomparable attractions and love took triumphant possession of him
During this interval short as it was the officer had got up unseen by our hero and was coming towards him This constrained him to transfer his attention from the lady to the gentleman He asked in a firm voice if he dared justify his conduct to which he was answered
No sir it was unpardonable It was wine it was distraction I have suffered an ignominious blow but I deserved it and you are a stranger No sir I shall ask for no satisfaction for light and blameable as I may have behaved though my existence depends on my courage and the sword is my profession I dare not draw it in a dishonourable cause
Sir Sidney who at first thought very differently of this business especially when he heard Emma exclaim as they approached the chamber
Oh Christ there is Mr Hazard
felt from the strongest conviction a warm glow of gratitude towards our hero This however was a little checked by reflection as well as a contemplation of what Charles was then doing who forgetting there were a number of spectators present stood like a statue devouring with his eyes the beauty of Annette which was now heightened by conscious innocence and thankful pleasure In this short interval during which Sir Sidney deliberated Annette was modestly delighted Emma hugged herself and our hero was fascinated in came to their relief Mr Gloss who being in a few words informed of the business went up in a style of the greatest familiarity to Charles and seizing him by the hand cried out
My dear sir how do you do I thought you were in Italy For Gods sake why dont you let your friends hear from you
Charles flung from him in great indignation saying
I dont know you sir
and was making towards the door but Sir Sidney who could not bear to receive a service of such magnitude without noticing it stopt him saying
I cannot refrain from warmly acknowledging this unexpected kindness which has been as bravely and gallantly as disinterestedly shewn me You know Mr Hazard I have a warm heart and a generous action touches it therefore this of yours which has probably saved my honour I shall not you may be assured think lightly of and if—
Surely said Charles recovering himself into a complacent yet erect dignity you jest Sir Sidney What I have done is at best but a common duty which requires no partial thanks because the greatest stranger would have been equally entitled to it But how do you know it was not the act of one ravisher anxious to defeat the designs of another I dare say it will have that colour by to-morrow morning In the mean time you shall be assured I am honest in something nor will you doubt it when I tell you that whatever motive induced me to that which has preserved Miss Roebucks honour to her family it was not friendship to her father and so sir good night to you
So saying he bowed respectfully to the ladies and left the room
